"## 1. Allow them some ""alone"" time

The most important thing for a parent with a very sensitive child is to understand them and accept them as they are. A HSC needs their own space and time to recharge themselves. This can be as important as breathing.

### 2. Show some Empathy

 A common question many parents ask is: how to help a very sensitive child? All you need is to understand and be sympathetic to them. It is important to understand that having HSC at home might mean more stares, more emotional flare ups, more pain, and more emotionally intense experiences.  It is normal for the parents of such a child to feel upset from time to time and lose their patience but you need to work on acceptance.

### 3. Approval

 Never apologize to people for the child’s emotions and sensitivity. They are born with it and every time they apologize to people for being how they are, they may feel that their emotions, sympathy, sensitivity, or the way they behave is somehow wrong. This can lower his self-esteem.

### 4. Gradually help them face their fears

 Help them do things that they are afraid of or dread in a slow and gradual manner.  This may help them overcome certain aversions. However, this should be done at a gradual pace and not in a hurry.For example, a child may refrain from wearing a cardigan because she feels itchy in it.   You might ask her to wear it for a short time to get used to it and then praise her. If the sensation begins to go away, it may be worth keeping up.   Children may find it helpful to face some aversive stimuli when it’s not harmful to their well-being, but this should not be framed or used as a punishment.

### 5. Keeping a Pet

 HSC love animals, so use their preference and make the house better by having a pet for them.   Having a pet at home will calm them down, and they will also have a companion to play with. You may want to watch out for allergies but beyond that, a pet is a great idea.

### 6. Do not use common methods of discipline for HSC

 Using common serious methods of punishment such as yelling, and others will only make matters worse for a highly sensitive child. They can respond to this by screaming, crying, and throwing angry tantrums.   Therefore, disciplining highly sensitive children should be done differently. You should talk to them and emphasize aspects like consequences and well-being, helping them better understand themselves.

### 7. Talk to your child when upset

 When you see your child crying, ask them why.  Talk to them when they are upset and validate their feelings even when you feel that the reason was minor.   Engaging in dialogue and respecting the child’s feelings is especially important with a HSC.

### 8. Help them stand against the bullies

 Highly sensitive children might cry or be different from their peers, so they have a higher risk of being bullied by other children at school. In such a situation, first of all, teach your child not to be afraid.   If such a situation arises, tell them that they should put a brave face in front of the bullies and tell the teacher about it. As a parent, you should also go and talk to the teacher and the school authorities.

### 9. Do not try to change them

 Highly sensitive children cannot help that they feel the way they do. They are born this way.   Thus, a parent should accept this and not try to change it. Attempting to change this sensitivity would only prove detrimental to the child’s overall development.

### 10. Accept your HSC and appreciate them 

 A very sensitive child is endowed with many good qualities that you can b e proud of.   You will realize that they are more caring, kind, and sympathetic to people and animals than many children their age. They are very sociable and can read a person well.   They are usually very creative and may become great writers / storytellers, actors and artists. Therefore, accept them and appreciate them for the person they are.  the whole article====&gt; [https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html](https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html?fbclid=IwAR3-EWcs2USCXHU-_xp0Ua3B8SckwCCSfD17o0tfpsQxvRrGx69SfTGiWbw)",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,This means that it is so important for children to find a certain sensitivity and concentration.
"((Also posted in r/pregnancy so I can get different perspectives.))

I was told by my lactation consultant that baby has tongue tie and we should get it corrected. I found a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and performing the laser treatment to correct it.

However - if baby is primarily formula fed now (my milk production is too low to fully feed on breast but she still gets her breastmilk snack every feeding session) is it worth putting the baby through the procedure?

Researching online - the primary objective of this surgery is to help the baby latch and improve breastfeeding. If that is all the correction is for, I don’t want to put my baby through a procedure she doesn’t need...what do I do?

Edit/Note: Correcting tongue tie could hopefully stimulate milk production, however I’m currently on antibiotics so I’m unable to breastfeed for another week (pump and dumping). One breast does not produce milk at all. This happened after the last round of antibiotics. Therefore I don’t think the tongue tie is the sole reason for lack of milk production and correcting it may not bring my milk back.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"(Also posted in r / pregnant so I can experience different perspectives) I was told by my lactation consultant that baby has tongue shirts and we should have them corrected.

"**Education regarding breastfeeding should begin once a mother is**[ **pregnant**](https://pregnancycentr.com/7-weeks-pregnant-belly/)**. The biggest worry a brand new mother usually verbalizes is ‘do you think that I actually have enough milk?’ once they square measure troubled and feeling they’re not activity enough for his or her baby, is much too late. It is a small amount like ‘shutting the gate once the horse has barred.** 

 

**Why not teach them before the birth about the ways to stop this happening, to have a chance of success?**

**Often it is the new mother’s lifestyle that is the contributing factor as they have been caught up in the euphoria of the birth and a multitude of visitors! They are so busy pleasing the visitors by chatting, making tea, and showing off their newborn baby, they become exhausted. So many new mums are on a ‘high’ after the birth and try to carry on as normal. It is a few days /weeks later when they are having problems, that they realize they did too much too soon.**

## Breastfeeding mothers

**The key to establishing a good milk supply in the early days is rest. The mother’s body needs time to recover from the birth and to be able to make milk. Often it is put on overload! All the responsibilities in the house should be offloaded to another family member.**  **Expectations regarding standards may have to be lowered during this time! This will enable them to relax and reduce their stress level. Have set rest times so that if friends and relatives want to visit, these periods can then be avoided. It also gives the new mother and father the assurance of knowing there is space in the day for them. I have seen new parents weeping with tiredness because the doorbell has gone non-stop and they have been making endless cups of tea. Remember the telephone and front door need to be controlled in the day to cope with the night shift as well!** 

 

### how to increase breast milk?

**All breastfeeding mothers need to watch their fluid intake very carefully. This has a strong influence on making plenty of milk. They need to replace what they are giving out to the baby and drink enough for their own hydration and to make more milk. This is where a lot of mothers go wrong. My advice is to always have a drink beside them before they breastfeed and drink it by the time they have finished feeding. Water, unsweetened fruit juices or milk are preferable Very often when I have questioned a mother who is struggling with her milk supply, this is a key factor. She has just drunk her usual 3** [**cups of tea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Cups_of_Tea)**! Eating and drinking well are very important to produce good milk. It has been suggested that drinking certain herbal teas such as fennel, increases lactation, but the effectiveness of this has not yet been proved.**",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"* * Education about breastfeeding should begin as soon as the mother * * is pregnant *. * * (https: / / pregnancycentr.com / 7-week-pregnant-belly /) * * The biggest trouble a new mother usually verbals is, remember, I actually have enough milk? < / unk > (once they are too large and have to worry about not having enough activity for their baby - that's far too late.

"- inverted nipples, baby would not latch. I really wanted to breastfeed. The first night in the hospital I was crying all night - not from pain from the c section, not from pain to my nipples, but because we just could not make breastfeeding work.

- the next morning, I was offered a shield by the day nurse. I was in love - it enabled us to feed. He latched immediately, was sucking immediately. However, I was told I had to pump after every feed to ensure I was emptying my breasts. 

- baby lost a little too much weight in first week (went from 3400g to 3005 in 5 days, then back up to 3420 by day 17 of life). During this time we were followed by a lactation consultant as well. While we did make the long term goal of getting off the nipple shield, it wasn't in the cards right now. Without needing to supplement, baby reached birth weight juuuuust over two weeks. Doctor was okay with this weight loss and then gain considering the emergency section.

- when we reached birth weight, we were then advised by LC to wean off of pumping. She recommended cutting out night pumping entirely, pumping every other daytime feed for a week. Then to titrate down to once a day (she recommended mixing up the time of day I pumped). 

Birth: 3400g
5 days: 3005g
1 week: 3140g
2 weeks: 3420g
4 weeks: 3855g
5 weeks: 4125g

Today, 5 weeks 4 days, my dog destroyed my pump parts. I was dumb. I had left them on the coffee table for like 5-10 minutes. The bottle neck is likely still usable, but the connecting piece/lid piece that goes on the bottle and connects to the actual pump is destroyed. The neck is crushed, the part that connects to the breast shield is crushed. I had a good cry. Yelled at my dog (fruitlessly, she doesn't understand, but I was frustrated and upset and yelled anyways), then went on amazon and ordered replacement parts. Unfortunately, with the holiday weekend this weekend (Canada, eh?), amazon estimates delivery Sept 7th. 

So my question being, will my supply suffer terribly if I can't pump for a week? I'm stressing out a little bit - I was on domperidone because of my 'slow start' but after my month prescription ended, my doctor took me off. She felt I didn't need it anymore.

"After being a little in denial about it for a few weeks (supply while pumping dropped, little guy happily drinking a bottle of formula after nursing), I've realized that my supply is just not quite there. I'm also tired of dealing with the screaming before nursing and am looking forward to having some independence from the little guy. So at a little over 10 months into it, I'm going to cut out a pumping session at work. And then another. And then the third. And then we'll see how it goes. 

I've been reading the old posts on weaning and am so grateful for the advice and reassurance in those posts/from the community. I never questioned my decision to bf, and fought like hell to EBF until he was 4m old (was at work at 12wks), and I'm realizing that I'm feeling a little sad when thinking about weaning. I don't think he'll be upset, but I'm realizing that this phase in our relationship is coming to an end. And as awful as it was at moments (thrush, biting, cluster feeding, distracted feeding), it's been amazing to provide him with the nutrition this whole time. 

I guess my question is that after I cut out the pumping during the day - which feeding do I drop? I'm guessing the morning one since he doesn't seem that interested in it, and then the night one is the last to go? Is it okay to start offering a bottle after nursing before bed too?

"As the title suggests I’m looking to get my RN with an eye towards being a CNM/WHNP. Having babies has been absolutely life changing for me, and the people who helped me achieve this goal (doctors and labor and delivery nurses) are women I’ll cherish forever.

So while it’s not for me, i have zero issues encouraging a laboring mom to go for it. I also didn’t breastfeed my children but fully support a mom who wishes to do it - it just didn’t work out for me with my first child and with the second I wasn’t interested in pushing the issue since I was juggling a toddler.

"As we continue our journey using CBD, we continue see my daughter reaching her full potential.  We would love to share the benefits we have seen by using CBD.
We have recently switched oils to one that is CBD/CBG. It is an oil that has the highest amounts of CBG.  What is CBG? Cannabigerol is the pre-curser or mother phytocannabinoid.  It has a direct effect on the Enndocannabinoid System and cannabinoid receptors. CBG is very exciting because it helps with some many things that are beneficial for DS. A major finding with CBG is it's neuroprotective and neurodegenerative traits.  Also, it a very valuable resource for gut health, as it's phytonutrients directly attack infectious bacteria.  It's other values are supports bone health, improves mood, and promotes natural analgesic (discomfort relief).

One of my major concerns is the fact of so many children with DS develop early onset of dementia and Alzheimer's.  There are many studies that have been done or are being done on how CBD slows or can possibly prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.  So knowing this is a major reason I will continue to give this to my daughter. 
Update on Ari
Behavior: CBD/CBG have defiantly helped with behavior. It has gotten her out of the fight/flight mode.  A balanced enndocannabinoid system will bring anyone out of the constant fight/flight mode.  And we definatly see that with Ari. The crazy melt downs in a store or where ever, are very far and few between.  It's not to say she never has an episode just like NT children, but we don't need to walk on egg shells wondering if we should bring her places. 
We have continued to notice her increased focus.  This just adds to every aspect.  Being able to sit longer, be engaged in an activity longer.  With this she is then able to learn more and apply what she is learning.
Speech Therapy: We have seen great results in her speech. From going from trying to decipher her language to being able to have clear communication is happy dance in its self.  She is reaching goals in speech therapy faster.  So lessons are moving quickly.
Physical Therapy: I'm excited about her gains.  We use to set new goals about every 2-3 months.  Now we set monthly goals. This goes hand in hand with her focus.  Being able to focus and understand, her strength and abilities are coming at a faster rate.  It's so nice to leave every Therapy with a therapist amazed she doesn't fit into their limited beliefs. OT basically has the same results

I do believe that age does play a small part in her success, but the 2 together is definitely a great combo.

With sharing our adventure I have been truly blessed to be able to help other families across the world.  Many sharing similar outcomes. So feel free to reach out to me with any questions. I can share with you what we use and help you to get the same oil. So feel free to email me at castlemom6@icloud.com or slh407@yahoo.com

"Corbin James' VBAC Birth story


This is an update to the post I made when I was 14 weeks along: [Feeling Discouraged About VBAC but Can't Bring Myself to Choose Repeat C](https://www.reddit.com/r/vbac/comments/5c4uaz/feeling_discouraged_about_vbac_but_cant_bring/) 
I'll preface this by saying that even though my VBAC had interventions and complications, I am so relieved and happy that I didn't have to go through major surgery again. 

Earlier on, I was worried that the OB I'd been seeing didn't want me to go past 40 or maybe 41 weeks. I ended up seeing 2 other doctors in the same OB practice later in my 2nd and 3rd tri who were much more encouraging and optimistic about attempting a VBAC. I tried to request these specific providers for most of my remaining appointments and just hoped they'd be on call if I went into labor on my own. This baby seemed to be measuring at least a pound smaller than my first baby (who ended up being 9lb 5oz) which was very reassuring. Still, I kept telling myself I probably wouldn't go into labor and tried to mentally prepare myself for another c-section...

...Which brings us to Thursday, May 11 (I was 40w+2d). I took my 3yo to his gymnastics class and sat in the waiting room clucking with the other hens. While I was there I felt what seemed like strong BH contractions but shrugged them off, convinced that was all they were. Throughout the rest of the day they were definitely uncomfortable but I was still in denial until late afternoon/early evening. I turned the TV on for my son and started packing, organizing &amp; getting cleaned up just in case something was happening. At some point, I went to the bathroom &amp; out came some of the mucus plug, with the rest to follow a few hours later. By the time my husband got home from work I was pretty sure I was in labor, so we called my MIL to come &amp; get big boy. 

I bounced and swayed on the exercise ball while timing the contractions on the Full Term app. They seemed to start really picking up around 8 or 9pm, and they were close together but still irregular (about 35-45sec long and 2.5-3min apart most of the time.) In between contractions I chatted with my husband and we went over last minute plans &amp; instructions. I was in such disbelief that I had actually gone into labor on my own. 

After a while the ball became too painful so I put a towel on the floor and gripped the end of the bed while swaying back &amp; forth on my knees for each contraction. They stayed confusing and irregular, but when they started becoming super painful I just knew it was go time. My husband loaded the car &amp; we left sometime after 11 for the hospital. It's about 15min away so I had a few contractions in the car, and had to yell a little during them but was still excited and in good spirits in between.  

We got checked in &amp; a nurse wheeled me up to my L&amp;D room. The ward was empty except for us and the nurse did not look thrilled to see me. Contractions were coming about 2 minutes apart at this point. I went to the bathroom and as I was attempting to collect a urine sample, I felt a gush &amp; saw some blood, but wasn't really sure if my water had broken. I got into the bed &amp; felt a couple small gushes so the nurse took a quick peek &amp; said she didn't think so. She then proceeded to tell me this baby was probably going to be as big or bigger than my first. (WTF lady?!) I turned my head to exchange an incredulous eye roll with my husband, rather than punching her in the face. 

Apparently I was dilated to about a 3 so they hung a bag of fluids and said I could have pain relief once it was empty. This took FOREVER!! I focused on the center of a fan in the ceiling and breathed through the contractions for...I don't know...about an hour but it felt like a long ass time! They became excruciatingly painful, almost scary painful at times. My husband reminded me to breathe and told me I was doing great. 

At some point, the doctor showed up (one of my 2 favorite ones!) and I was happy to see her. She determined I was still at a 3 and there was a little bit of meconium in my waters. The anesthesiologist placed my epidural shortly thereafter. It got a little scary because my blood pressure bottomed out 3 times and I had to get the ephedrine shot each time to bring me back. After that drama, I labored another few hours contracting perfectly on my own but without much progress, which started to worry me. The doctor suggested a tiny bit of Pitocin to help me along, which was surprising and I normally would not have agreed to it but I actually trust this doctor. She reassured me that at such a small dose the risk was minimal. 

My husband and I slept for a while and in the morning who should appear but my OTHER favorite OB! She was still on board with the VBAC and upped my Pitocin just a little. For the next several hours, it was a lot of back &amp; forth with the RN checking me &amp; being very pessimistic, then the OB checking after her &amp; saying I was actually 1-2cm further than the RN had said. Once I got to about an 8 according to the nurse, my OB came in and said she could probably stretch it. So she did, and I started pushing. I'm pretty sure they had turned the epidural down some time ago because I had pain at the top of my belly and also at my right hip, making it harder for me to curl up while pushing. The nurse held my right leg while my husband held the left. I probably did about 15 pushes before the OB said his head was right there but he wasn't coming out. She suggested using the forceps, and I didn't know much about them but there wasn't much time for that so I said okay. It was really strange watching her twist &amp; pull on my baby's head with these things and I tried not to think gruesome thoughts. I heard her request scissors &amp; then a quick ""snip"" sound...Oh yay, an episiotomy. 

But then he was out! And he had so much hair! And they put him right on me! I said my hellos and told him how warm and slimy he was, and then watched as my husband cut the cord right there on my belly! 

Corbin James G. weighed 8lb 4oz and measured 20""long. The OB said the reason he couldn't come out was because his hand was up by his face (just like it was in all of his ultrasounds.) I got to hold him and nurse him there for a long time and was so relieved that we didn't have to be separated. Even after Pitocin, forceps, episiotomy, and a 2nd degree tear I'm still happy to have avoided the c-section experience we went through with our first. Recovery has been tough but not nearly as bad as the first time around, and I've been able to manage the pain with just ibuprofen. Corbin is nursing pretty well and had mostly gained his birth weight back at his 2 week appointment yesterday. He's adorable and we're so happy and proud of both of our boys!

"Feeling really sad.

I dont even know how to start this, other that saying im really crush, so bare with me with a long post.

Im a single mom, I got pregnant by a man who wanted a baby and was in a serious relationship. The same day I told him I was pregnant he said he didn’t want me, and although I did try to have a relationship with him things got out of control because he was abusive in every way you could think to me and later on to my son, feeding him with hot peppers so my son wouldn’t ask for the salad he was having for lunch.

I left him , and other than giving me money ( that doesn’t even cover 50% of his son expenses) he doesn’t see my son ever.

I met this guy last year, single no kids, for a while I would say we went on dates but nothing ever happened not even a kiss , but he loved children and eventually met my son and he was amazing to my son and I considered him to be a great role model. I thought there was empathy because the guy who I will call D , had lost his dad when he was 6.

I work with an intern that recently graduated but comes from a family that is having a really hard time financially wise, and I mentioned that to D. He said we should all go out to a nice restaurant and have a celebration for my intern. Soon enough that dinner totally turned into a match making dinner and comparisons started to draw right there. He went from basically denying we were close friends ( I mean so close we spend almost every weekend together, like my son and I at his place, of course me sleeping with my son, to beach trips , etc) to plain out loud telling her how good she looks. He would often say how impress she was by almost any coment, asking her for dreams for the future etc.

I hate to sound like a negative person but your dreams when you are so fresh out of college are so big, and often you realize that life has limitations and you wont turn out to be married to prince William.

He then turned to me, and asked her why do I always complaint about my job, that im such a negative person. I explained I have a whole lot more reponsabilities than her, and my boss (who is the owner) relies on me even when it comes to hire people at the factorie. I also have a child, and that will make anyone more more hours, even outside work line. The girl back me up saying my job is not nearly as stressful as hers , but then he said maybe I shouldn’t cook so much for my son and get him use to pbj sandwiches and man up.

I saw her, she is in her 20´s and Im in my mids 30. I know I cant ever compete with younger people specially those who invest 3 hours a day in gym , yoga and surfing. I get she has dreams and ambition, and I wish all her dreams come true, and I had those dreams that were limited when I decided to raise a child. Limited because I cant work as much as I would because I have things at home, and I am sorry im not so happy go lucky with things because reality is diferent for me.

But I was hurt by my friend choosing to question my opinions. I was hurt that I was blindisided that he was trying to do something goo and maybe noble and all he wanted was meeting her and get a number. I was crushed that my friend, the man I admired was making me seem so small, instead of cheering me up when he knows perfectly well how this path is so often difficult and challenging.

That maybe im not a heroe, but I am trying my hardest to raise a child I didn’t create on my own and I was lied into motherhood wich a total different plan. I had to quit my dream jon, the one I was CEO for Latin America SALES, so I could have more time with my son, so no im not stupid or not educated,.

"First off, sorry if this comes across disjointed or I ramble, I’m trying to get it all off my chest and I’m just typing whatever comes to mind. 

My partner and I have been together 11years and have three children 9,6 and 2. Our relationship has always been very strong and loving, we’ve had our ups and downs and we’ve treated each other like shit at times but we’ve always worked through our problems and come out the other side stronger and more grateful for what we have.  I honestly cannot ever imagine my life without him but this seems to be a recurring argument that we just cannot seem to settle on. We will argue about it, cool off and go back to how things were before but I’m getting close to breaking point now and I’m not sure if it’s me being unreasonable or if I am actually right in feeling so fed up. 

We got together long distance and after seeing each other only at weekends for a year I moved to his area and we rented a house together. I had been offered a place to start university to become a teacher and was actively looking for jobs when I found out I was pregnant with our first child. Nobody wanted to hire me being pregnant and I decided the best thing to do was defer my uni place for a year and start when our baby was 6months old (his mum looked after our child whilst I was in lectures etc). We followed the plan and I graduated 3years later whilst ready to pop with our second child. This has meant that from the very beginning my partner has provided for me on his own. And now 11years and three kids later he still does. There has never been an opportunity for me to work, even part time. Childcare is horrendously expensive and it makes no sense to either of us for me to put our youngest in childcare just so that all my work pay would go on paying for said childcare. I completely understand how lucky I am to have been able to bring up all of our children and be home to witness every milestone and school achievement while my OH has had to miss a lot through working. 

He wakes up at 5am mon-Friday, leaves at 6am and drives an hour to work where he does manual labour for 10/12 hours a day only to do the hour drive home and see kids for just an hour or so before their bedtime or sometimes not at all. I am so so grateful for all of his hard work and I tell him all the time how much he is appreciated and loved. I’ve even offered to work weekends so that I can bring in a little extra money as I feel so guilty that I cannot contribute financially. We do struggle on one income and he gets extremely worried how we will get through some months, but he won’t entertain the idea of me working weekends and says that the weekends are for us to spend together which I totally get and I feel very lucky for him to pick family time over money. It’s important to add that he is self employed so his pay can vary drastically from month to month. He doesn’t get any paid holiday or sick time and so every day off (especially the two weeks of Xmas) means he is loosing out on money that he will not get back. Of course this all adds to his stress. 

So anyway on to my issue. As a SAHM I expect and am totally happy to look after the kids and keep the household going. I do all the breakfasts and get the kids ready for school then spend the day with our youngest whilst tidying, sorting life admin and running errands, then once the two eldest are back from school I do any homework/reading/spellings they have to do, cook dinner every night and tidy the house again either just before they go to bed or after. I basically never stop. My head is a jumble of school activities and other appointments I need to remember, making sure the kids are always fed, clean and happy, keeping the house tidy and on top of that dealing with my narcissistic mother which I am currently on a waiting list to see a therapist for as she has/does cause me an immeasurable amount of stress. I have no down time apart from a few hours in the evening and even then I still have to shower and look after myself which if I’m being honest is the last thing I want to do.

As soon as my OH is home his tea is either nearly ready for him (once he has showered) or is on the table waiting for him. He doesn’t and hasn’t ever cooked in all the years we’ve been together (apart from the odd omelette and beans for the kids once in a blue moon or oven food which even then I have to either instruct him how to do it or intervene eventually), he doesn’t ever use his initiative to tidy up or help around the house but every so often (maybe every couple of months) will go on mad cleaning sprees where he tuts and huffs because the place is such a mess (it’s usually if I’ve been out all day or just not had the energy to do everything on my ever growing list). He has never done homework or spellings or reading with the kids (he only found out last week that our youngest has had a reading diary for the last two years that I have to fill out and leave comments in daily otherwise the school will bollock me/not change my youngest’s reading book). He never puts his dirty clothes in the washing basket, just leaves them lying about and I’m
pretty sure he has no clue how to use the washing machine. He doesn’t clear his plate away after eating (putting leftover food in the bin then putting plate in the sink to be washed) even though the kids know to do it, even our youngest at the age of 2 does it.

The latest thing, which has tipped me over the edge recently is him having a go at me for not cleaning out the car regularly enough. I’m not just talking about getting all the coats, socks, toys, drinks bottles etc out of it, which I do already, but a whole fucking valet! He wants it hoovered and polished too. We brought the car (a sporty hatchback, his choice) a few months ago after having a very old, rundown and unreliable car for the last couple of years. I get that he is proud of it and wants to keep it tidy but if he thought a family of five sharing a smallish car wasn’t going to end up with muddy footprints and crumbs all over it then he should’ve brought something older and bigger. Yes we both drive it but it was his choice of car, his baby (god that sounds so cringy sorry!) so I don’t see why he can’t make the effort once a week or whenever he sees fit to clean it himself. When does he want me to do this car cleaning exactly, in the middle of the night when I’ve finally got everything else done?! 

Guys I’m so sorry for the rant but I just wanted to get it all down so you can read all the evidence. I know I’ve probably made him out to sound like a horrible person but he is such a great dad and partner in every other way and he always puts us first before himself. Our relationship is great apart this issue and that’s why I struggle to hold my own and stick to my guns when an argument about this arises. 

His argument is that he works 12hr days, has all the stress of having to pay for us all and find the money for everything and” if it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t have a house that needs cleaning or any food to make dinner with in the first place”. Every time we argue he ends up just making me feel like I’m being a spoilt brat and majorly ungrateful and I end up just feeling like my feelings are inferior to his. And as I said before, we cool off and things pick up as normal which only adds to me feeling like maybe I’m being too harsh on him. 

It’s only ever us, my family lives hours away and I have major trouble with them. And his parents/family live 45mins away but never come to visit, ring to ask how the kids are or offer to help out it’s always one sided with us doing all the visiting etc so the kids don’t miss out completely but we never get time for ourselves separately or together which of course only adds to both of our stresses. We’ve not had a date night in over 3years. 

Am I being unreasonable here? Or do I have a solid argument about the way things are? I have no idea how to fix this without an argument that leads to no change, only resentment. I do not want to and would not tear my family apart over this but sometimes I just feel like running away. I don’t want to be the house cook and cleaner for the rest of my life.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

"He is almost 15 and I had to pull him from the final month of school last year for home schooling. He gets migraines that are largely anxiety/stress induced.

"Hello /r/adoption. I am seeking advice on how to reach out to my first-father’s widow (who I will call “A’”). I am a late-discovery adoptee who learned I was adopted at 18. Late last year, I found my first-father’s obituary. He passed away seven years ago, the same year I learned I was adopted. 

In March, my mom helped me find the life-partner who was listed in his obituary. My mom and A talked a little back and forth, and my mom passed along my email address. A was so sweet and thoughtful and seemed enthusiastic. She said she would be in touch and would compile some photos of my dad for me. She even said that she had some of my dad’s things & his ashes and would happy to send them to me. (I don’t think it's my place to accept them?, but it meant so much that she offered.)

It’s been six months now, and I have not heard from her. 

I have A’s email address, and would like to reach out to her. It’s complicated though - I’m not actually related in any way to this person, by blood or by law, so she has even less reasons to want to help me than a relative would. It also appears that she did not know about me (she told my mom, “He’d be beyond stoked to know he had a daughter! That’s crazy fantastic to hear!”), and when my mom spoke with her, Mom didn’t explain that my dad did know about me. (I’m told he actually raised me and played with me and loved me for a year before his parental rights were terminated.)

I want to tread very lightly and gently - I know this person owes me nothing, and I don’t want to awaken any feelings of grief. I can’t imagine how much it must hurt to lose your life partner, and then have that person’s daughter come looking for you for answers almost a decade later. I don’t know if it would hurt her to know that my dad did know about me, and didn’t tell her. (Please note that I don’t judge my dad for not telling her - maybe he buried the grief, etc.)

Does anyone here have any advise on what to say? Should I write a longer message, explaining who I am and telling her a little about myself and a short list of questions? Should I write a very brief message, just checking in? She isn’t related to me and has no reason to help me. But she is the only person I am aware of who knew my dad, and probably the closest to him. I feel terrible for intruding on her life, and want to tread lightly.

Here is what I have composed so far. Please let me know what you think.

*Hello A,*

*This is (my name), the daughter of the woman who reached out to you a few months back about (my dad’s name). I was hoping you might be willing to talk with me about your partner/my dad, (dad’s name).*

*I want to say that I am sorry to reach out - it’s been a while since you and my mom, (mom's name) talked, and I was worried maybe you had lost my contact information. I also want to say that it is very important to me to be respectful to what a strange situation this might be for you, and say that I am more than happy to go at whatever pace you are comfortable with.*

*Would you be okay with me asking some questions about (dad's name)? I can tell you about myself if you would like or if it would make you more comfortable.*

*Thank you so much for your time,*

*(my name)*


Thank you for reading.

"Hello Gents, 

Tl;Dr: How can I help my wife stay motivated to keep working out like she wants to while morning sickness is keeping her down?

Something like 6 weeks along and morning sickness is kicking in pretty hard on her. She stayed home two days in the last two weeks because it was so bad. She's exhausted, I mean rightly so seeing as how she's growing a human, and doesn't want to work out but keeps stressing how she's bloated, gaining weight, and only wants to snack. 

I tried giving her workout tips in the moths leading up to us getting pregnant but she never took up any of them and now she's adding on some weight (plus bloating so that only makes it seem worse). I read thought that first time mom's tend to gain more than those on their second or beyond. 

Through AL this I've got to admit, I'm worn down from all her complaining. She's remaining adamant that she's not going to gain more than 25lbs... I can't workout for her and I've exhausted all the, ""let's go together,"" ""I'll make a plan for you,"" and etc. routes.  I honestly don't care how much she does or doesn't gain as long as they both stay healthy.

"Hello Reddit community. I'm a first time Dad and I was just wondering if I could get an input on something. How Dangerous is it to let my newborn baby boy sleep on my chest?

My Father-in-law is going to be helping us watch the little guy for the next month since I will be away at work most of the time(thanks grandpa) and he loves to put him on his chest. But a few times he has fallen asleep with him there(scary!)

"Hello again all,

Myself (29M) and my partner (32F) are now 13 weeks 5 days pregnant from the time this was posted. For information purposes we are both in Las Vegas NV and I work for a well known casino here. Also I apologize for this whole post jumping around and being random. I'm stressed. 

Now that we are in the second trimester my partner is finally mostly past her morning sickness and feeling like crap and basically looking like she might die, which is a good thing! She still gets slight nausea, but is able to keep food down a lot more and is a LOT more active which is awesome. During her time near the end of her first trimester I had two jobs lined up for her which she didn't feel well enough to do either (One working Front Desk, the other working in a Call Center, both for the same company I work for just different departments) so she never called back either manager.

Now that she's feeling better we are talking more and preparing more for our child, today after lunch my mother gave us some money because she wanted to pay for our Car Seat for the baby, so we went to Babies R Us since it's closing however we both noticed how expensive things were. Nice car seats were 120-300, Stroller combos were almost 400, cribs were 200-500, clothing, bottles, formula, all of this insanely expensive. I think it was a very large awakening for both of us and panic set in.

I'm the only one working in our household, we pay 969 a month rent, and basically after all bills we have 700$ left over. This is NOT including food for us, or anything for the baby yet. So obviously I'm worried... Especially once our child arrives I'll still be the only one working because I KNOW she will want to stay home with the baby, and she doesn't want me to work two jobs due to not seeing me and helping but... It's also not the 1950s anymore... Shit is far harder as I'm sure a lot of you know. I only make 16.70 an hour so I'm kinda freaking out, just right now she said she thinks she should start working but if she has an on call job wouldn't we lose our Medicaid? Also now that she says she thinks she should work she doesn't want to work for any of the guaranteed jobs I had lined up for her but wants to find work at something more ""ethical"" or that ""serves a higher purpose"" yet as far as I know there isn't ANYTHING like that in Vegas... So... Wtf?

Also we have NO idea what brands for baby stuff are to be trusted, I've tried looking and reading into stuff however there are SO many different opinions it all seems to contradict one another... I have no idea what the best car seat is, stroller, backpack... Thing? (diaper bag) or diapers, food, pacifiers, nothing, I feel so unprepared for this child and scared yet I try to put a brave face on for my partner because she's TERRIFIED that stuff isn't going to work out or that we will live in poverty... So I'm lost as hell.

The only people who know are very close family on my side and only her mother on hers... When I talk to her about telling people on hers she just says ""when the time is right"" but wouldn't you want to tell people sooner than later in order for them to be hyped up more or want to help more? Or... Idk. We are definitely going to have to have two separate baby showers just because all her side is in Washington and mine is down here and I don't even know where to begin with that or when to do it.

What do we do?!

TL:DR - I don't know what the hell we are doing and baby is coming.

I don't really know what kind of child that could be makes you die, which is a good thing.

"Hello all!

I am currently pregnant with twins who are due 1/27, and my daughter is 9 months old (yes, we are panicking!). I am wondering if anyone has experience with an age gap like this, and primarily what stroller options we should be looking into.

"Hello all! I hope that your day is going well. I am a FTM to a 10-month-old girl. I had always wanted to bed share, but was too scared to at first. I struggled pretty badly with PPA, and was so worried about SIDS. Now that my PPA has passed and my daughter is older we have been bed sharing more and more. It started out only in the mornings and is sort of moving earlier and earlier. Also, we are being hit pretty hard by teething and my little one just wants to be close more. I would be fine bed sharing full time, but there are a few obstacles. I have moved my mattress to the floor and was feeling pretty comfortable. However, my DD is a very active sleeper and last night rolled off of the mattress in her sleep. Poor little thing woke up screaming and I think the fall scared her. I am not sure what to do to protect from this. I have pretty much moved everything out of our room like dressers and my clothes rack (our apartment doesn’t have closets sadly).  We have a crib that can turn into a toddler bed and I have thought about setting that up and making it flush with out mattress. 

What are your bedsharing setups? Do you use bed rails? Any tips, tricks, advice, or experience that you can share would be very much appreciated!

A little extra info:  my husband is away on business for the next few months so it is only me and DD in the bed. I am pretty aware of her when I sleep except when really exhausted and I try to put her in her crib on those nights for at least 3 or 4 hours. I don’t drink or smoke.

"Hello all,

I recently started working as a caregiver for a 6 y.o. with DS. His behavior is balanced while he is on his medication, but in the times in early morning and periodically throughout the day his behavior includes opposition defiance. I'm currently giving him two choices that both lead to the desired result; i.e. if he doesnt want to get dressed - i tell him that if he gets dressed he can do/have ""X"" that he is wanting - I then give him a choice between two pieces of clothing.

Any ideas?

"Hello everyone, my wife (34) and I (33) found out last Wednesday that we are 8.5 weeks along with di/di twins. We already have a little boy who is a little over 2.5 years old. I found this subreddit while frantically googling everything I could about having twins in the days since.

My amazing wife, who ended up with preeclampsia just prior to delivering our son last time, has been really fatigued and really nauseous this time around. Coupled with her own stress about this pregnancy, the future, her career, finances, etc., it’s been a rough week. 

Just thought I’d drop an initial post to introduce our situation, say thanks to all the contributors in this subreddit (reading old posts on here has been quite helpful in taking the edge off, since it’s clear our situation has been mastered by others before us), and to say we will probably be posting more as we learn more (and have more pointed questions) throughout this pregnancy.

I am trying to research on the current habits of heating baby-milk and, specifically, I want to know if microwave ovens are actually being used for this purpose. Many people doesn't want to admit that they use microwave to heat their babies' food/milk, as it isn't socially accepted (because we do not really know if microwaves are harmful), so I have developed a very short anonymous survey (it takes less than 30 seconds to answer), to get the real thoughts of parents. This is just a small part of my research, as I intend to analyze the effect of microwaves in baby-food at a molecular structure, but I need to get a realistic estimation of the usage of microwaves when heating baby food.

I am trying to research the current habits when heating baby milk and, in particular, I want to know if microwave ovens are really being used for this. A lot of people don't want to admit that they use microwaves to warm up the food / milk of their babies because this is not socially acceptable (because we don't really know whether microwaves are harmful), so I have made a very short, anonymous poll (it takes less than 30 seconds to answer) to find out the true thoughts of parents. This is only a small part of my investigation because I intend to study the effect of microwaves on baby tissues."

"Hello!  Current pre-dad here (due date August 18!) getting the nursery all set up and looking for advice.

"Hello! I hope you are having a good day.

So, at the suggestion of some others here I picked up Oh Crap, we're on block 2.
Day 1, she peed in little drips on the potty and then mostly in her nap and night diapers. Day 2 she was a lot more eager to sit, sat a bunch but held her pee and towards the end of the day finally had a great big pee in the potty. She was super excited to dump it in the toilet and get to wash her hands. Day 3 i had a shirt on her and she again had just one great big pee. I almost had her convinced to poop in the potty that day, I could see she had to, but she ended up not being willing and pooped in the bath that night.

I checked the book and reread parts of it and decided as long as she is pooping somewhere and I know she isn't stopped up, I will try and let it go.

Because she had peed in the potty two days in a row and wasnt peeing on the floor (this whole time she only has once) I decided to move on to block 2 at day 4, yesterday. She woke up in a bad mood yesterday and refused any liquids all morning, did not pee in her nap diaper, finally took liquids in the afternoon and evening and still no pee in the potty. She didn't poop that day, the first day she hadn't pooped somewhere. All day she was super fussy and cried any time I brought up the potty, so i just tried not to push it on her. We had to do some driving around in the evening so we spread a diaper over the car seat, but left her commando.

Today, day 5, she is in a little better of a mood and has been willing to sit on the potty once, but is still not drinking much and still mostly crying about sitting on the potty. She is also again holding any pee or poop, no floor accidents, no wet pants, but no potty either.

Is this just resistance? Did I transition to pants too soon?

Also, I did what the book said and spent the first day (the first 3 days) just watching my daughter, no phone no tv no computers and I never found her pee dance. The best I could get was she would sometimes",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Hello!

She was super excited to do it on the potty and got her hands washed. Day 3 I was wearing a shirt, and she had just a big pee again.

Why do new parents purchase pumps or put them on gift registries?  If you plan on bottle feeding (your own concoction or 'formula') then you don't need one.  If you plan on breastfeeding, you don't need one.  If you plan on bf when you go back to work, which can be months or years down the road, depending on where you live, then you don't need one until then and you may decide at that point that you don't want to pump.  How do you know, until you know your baby, which pump will be the best fit?  Why not wait until you decide if you need it before buying it?

"Hey All,

I'm sharing something exciting here that may be of interest to you breastfeeding mamas -- it's a simple, three-step kit to turn your breast milk into a balm.

When I first experienced the magical effects my breast milk had for both my baby and myself, I was blown away. From moisturizing his dry skin, to healing his diaper rashes, to soothing my own raw nipples (ouch), I knew I had to find a way to make the most of every drop!

That’s when Milk Balm emerged.

Milk Balm is the first all-natural, multi-use product of its kind that uses your own mama goodness to treat those motherhood woes.

Get the most out of your breast milk, too.

The Milk Balm Kit contains everything you need to make your own unique salve in three simple steps—just add your milk!

"Hey all! So glad I found this community but hate that I have to post already. 

My wife and I have a 7 week old son. He has been formula fed since the very beginning but we keep having issues. And we do have his two month appointment coming up so we will be discussing with our doctor but we are puzzled. Looking to see if anyone has had any similiar experiences. 

We started him on the Similac Pro-Advance. He had A LOT of trouble with gas. Constantly fussy because of it. He seemed miserable. We switched to Pro-Total Comfort. This helped with the gas some but his stools started becoming almost solid. I mean chunkier and harder than peanut butter. It was almost the consistency of clay. Once again, miserable. We called the doctor and she recommended 2-4oz. of prune juice. This worked fairly well. We figured it must be a formula issue so for the last 11 days, we have been using Gerber SoothePro. He is NEVER gassy on this one but the poop issue continues. He will turn red, push, strain, cry, etc. We have used prune juice, stomach massages, rowing his legs, and more! We eventually get him to poop but the consistency is still almost clay like and it takes hours to get him to poop. He hasn't pooped without some sort of assistance in a few weeks. I understand he's still learning how to work everything and where to push but the consistency is concerning. There has to be a solution!

Quick Recap
Pro-Advance: Miserably gassy
Pro-Total Comfort: Less gassy, clay like poop
SoothePro: No gas issues, still clay like poop

It has to be a formula issue, right? I don't want to jump the gun and think digestion issues. We use Dr. Brown bottles if anyone believes that makes a difference. 

Any and all help is appreciated!

"Hey everyone!

So a thought crossed my mind today. I am having a kid in July (our first) and we are pretty sure we are going to stop at one.

Reasons for this are varied, finances being one of them and 2nd biggest of all, hoping its going to be easier on us. Happier, less stressed parents with more free time may equal more energy and happiness for the kid, etc. (That's just personally how we think- others may be energized by or love a big family and that's great! But we are both pretty introverted and thrive on quiet and down time)

I'm nervous about the impending difficulties of parenthood, I will be honest. Many parents talk about how exhausting the work is, if it isn't a screaming newborn, a toddler into everything, diapers, bathtime, bedtime, soccer practice, screen time, homework, friends, are they drinking or smoking? Etc. 

I'm hoping to get some anecdotal evidence from you all because I don't really have a frame of reference (most people I've asked have 2, 3, 4 kids and talk about how difficult and exhausting it can be most days). How much easier is it to raise an only child? I'd imagine that raising 2, 3, 4+ would be, well, 2, 3, 4+ times as difficult overall because there are multiple bedtimes, teen mischief to worry about, activities to drive to, kids to drop off, conflicts to resolve, etc.

Could it be said that parents of an only get more free time as well?

I am an only child myself and as I got to be self sufficient we had family dinners, but my parents pretty much went off to do their own thing in the eve and we'd schedule a fun family date for the weekend, or maybe a family game night one evening a week. Otherwise I'd just run around outside, play video games, watch TV or read. I REALLY  enjoyed this model as a kid, and now that the tables are turned I think I'd enjoy this as a parent too.

It would be great to hear from you about the subject!

Thank you!",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"It has a variety of reasons and finances are one of them and the second largest of them all and I hope it would be simpler for us.

"Hey guys
My Second LO was born 2/22 via urgent Csection (labored with pitocin and epidural for 24 hours, failure to descend and had blood in urine). She was 7lbs3oz, totally perfect.

 Despite my best efforts I couldn't EBF  (PCOS, suspected IGT) and completely stopped combo feeding about a week ago. We gave her Enfamil Infant first, then switched to Newborn when we got home,  then in her 3rd week we switched her to Gentlease. Since her 2nd or 3rd week she's had green poops. They aren't frothy or mucousy or anything, pretty much the same consistency as normal poop. They are off and on. Sometimes yellow sometimes green.

However at her 1 month on Thursday I told her doctor that she was still having green poops, and they did an occult blood test which came out positive.

"Hey guys....first day on reddit. I posted this on the atheism subreddit and someone told me to cross post it here....not sure if there is a better way to crosspost other than copy/paste so I apologize if there is. Original post below

Hey everyone, new to reddit
A little about me....Grew up in the South with an extremely Baptist family. Growing up even mentioning that you had any doubts in the bible was trouble. Now I am the single mother to an awesome 7th grader named Sara. Sara is everything I was not as a child....shy, super smart straight A student, Kind, aka not a complete asshole like I was at that age. I have never pushed religion (or lack thereof) on her.....we don't really talk about it, there have been times when she has asked a question that I have answered to the best of my ability. She has gone to a friends church a few times and told me ""she had a great time but that she didn't really believe in it too much""
I had to pull her out of school today bruised and bloody. She is terrified to go back to school. She told me that she had been teased for a while because she mentioned she didn't believe in god (we are still in the South btw) She told me that now she thinks she was wrong, and that this was "" Gods punishment""....hearing that makes me madder than anything in this world. I have talked to a few teachers and the principal about the situation and they have not been able to help....I am probably going to end up pulling her out of this school.
Being a parent is tough.....financially I don't know what to do, between the medical bills.....the potentially having to miss some work to stay with her from school.....they severely damaged her Clarinet that she uses for band by smashing it on the pavement. What hurts the most is that this strong willed kid is absolutely defeated and broken......questioning her beliefs because of pressure and fear. I wish I could go kungfu mommy on all these little assholes.

"Hey ladies! So we started sleep training last Monday (it's been 1.5 weeks). We read The Sleepeasy Solution and it's worked great for nighttime sleep!

The problem is nap time. She was doing ok with naps in the beginning but now seems to be totally resisting them all together. She will not put herself down and we end up resorting to old methods just to get her some sleep. Book says babies this age should get 3-4hrs of naps a day. 
We are putting her down for naps not on an exact schedule but are shooting for: 
Nap1 - 1.5hrs after she wakes for the day. 
Nap 2 - 2 hrs after waking from nap 1
Nap 3 - 2 hrs after waking from nap 2 
Then bedtime 1-1.5hrs after nap 3.

"Hey there!

A few months ago I met a wonderful man. He is young (21), as am I (23). We get along very well, and we recently moved into a home together. Our lives are working out beautifully, and our communication seems to be very efficient. He has a 5-month-old son that I have fallen in love with--though I would never have imagined bringing a baby into my life before I met my boyfriend! 

Although most things seem to be going pretty smoothly, there have been some challenges that have surfaced, primarily involving my stepson's birth mother. She didn't want to have the baby to begin with, even threatening to kill him before he was born; my boyfriend fought to keep his son himself and prevent him from being put up for adoption (the baby's mother broke up with my boyfriend just a couple weeks after she became pregnant).

For the first four months of the baby's life, the BM had nothing to do with him at all. We heard nothing from her whatsoever, though she and my boyfriend have joint custody. But a couple of weeks ago she appeared out of nowhere and is trying to become involved with the baby's life. My boyfriend doesn't really have a choice but to let her see her son since he doesn't have sole custody and doesn't have the funds to take her to court for it. So, at least for the time being, she's directly involved with our new little family. I respect her role as the baby's biological mother, but it sometimes makes me feel like the ""fourth wheel"" to what would have been my boyfriend's family. I sometimes feel like I'm ""just the girlfriend""--I make the bottles, change the diapers and wash the clothes, but I don't really have a role beyond that. My bf has to be in contact with the BM in order to arrange for visits and whatnot, but he is attempting to be friends with her because she asked to be friends again. She knows about me but has expressed regret for not staying with my bf and ""having a complete family."" He says he isn't interested in being with her again, but at the same time he can't make her go away, so he might as well be friendly with her. Sigh. I feel like chopped liver, but there's not much I can do!

Have any of you all had similar situations with birth parents? Maybe it is because I'm young and all this is new to me, but I'm trying to avoid baby-mama-drama as much as I can.

"Hi Mommit! First time posting, so I hope this is the right place (if there’s better place to post this I’m all ears!) for my question. 

Basically the title...I have 2 boys, ages 6.5 and very nearly 10. Like any kids they love screens and when it’s playtime they’d go for their Xbox or a tablet every time if it were up to them, especially the older one. They do get time for that but it’s pretty limited (thanks parental controls) and when their time runs out, or if they’re already out of time when we say “find something to do, go play,” more and more often I’m hearing that there’s nothing else for them to do. 

Let me say - I am totally a believer in not solving this for them, not rescuing them from boredom, I know that coming up with something to do on their own is important, i am aware of the pitfalls of instant gratification and the benefits of struggling and problem solving, I use the “either find something to do or I can easily give you a chore” approach regularly, etc. 

Having said that, I feel like having toys/activities available to choose from that are age/level-appropriate seems pretty normal and I do think they’ve outgrown many of the things we have in the house, so it made me want to ask...

For those who have or know kids this age, what kinds of toys/activities do you see them reach for when screens or playing outside aren’t an option? 

Thanks! <span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 152, 138]'></span>",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Hi Mommit!

"Hi SAHPeeps!  I'm a stay-at-home-mom of a one-year-old.  I went back to work from when she was 3 to 6 months and then I said, ""NOPE! Nope. Nope... No."" and left my job to stay with my daughter.  We bought a house. I try to keep my house in decent shape. I suck at it a lot of times, but at least my kid is alive! The struggle is always a thing.

Anyway, I really enjoy talking about the craziness of being a parent, stay-at-home or not. Sometimes I think I sound a little neurotic so I started blogging. I know there are a bazillion mommy bloggers out there and I think it's a cool way for moms to feel connected and it helps me feel less isolated.  

I'd really love it if you guys could visit and give me some feedback. Or just have fun reading and commenting. I'm also interested in having ""guest bloggers"" if anybody wants to have a creative outlet for that sort of thing.  I'm not sure how that works, but it's something I'd like to explore if anyone can help me out with that.

I tend to be a little crass and I love edgy haikus and poems.  My name, Crunchy Unicorn, comes from a combination of my ""crunchy"" tendencies (cloth diapering, out-of-hospital birth, extended breastfeeding, etc.) and a meme I saw about Unicorn Moms (not perfect, enjoys alcohol, sense of humor, zero f*cks given) that I LOVED!

"Hi all,

More not so great news this week.

We've been having growth scans ever since we had an abnormal quad screen. We did a non-invasive test and ruled out downs and any chromosomal abnormalities but the doctor still wanted to do monthly growth scans in case there was a placental insufficiency.

Good thing they did. I give the doctor some mad props for that. Out last scan (before this week) was at 24W. The kiddo was doing great 40-50th percentile in everything except his stomach which was upper 30's. No cause for alarm.

Tuesday we had another scan this week, again most things were upper 30's to low 50's, but his stomach was a tiny 3% compared to what they like to see.

My heart sank. The pretty quickly diagnosed is with IUGR meaning the placenta isn't working great. They through us through dozens of more tests and my wife was also diagnosed with Mild-Preeclampsia. There is no high blood pressure indicators or any of the other signs but the protein during a 24 hour urine test was high, so they went ahead with the diagnosis so they could watch it more closely.

The doctor's goal is for us to hold the baby inside until week 34 (6 weeks from Tuesday). Which is amazing and at the same time super scary. 

Starting next week my wife will be starting short term disability at work (they've arranged for her to work a few hours from home daily but only clerical computer work). We have 3-4 appointments per week from here on out and I am freaking out.

From how the doctor described it they are watching closely because right now it's best for the baby to stay inside. It's still growing (although slowly) and getting some nutrients from the placenta. At some point they can provide better care in the NICU so they just want to catch the right time for when that happens.

Obviously we are freaking out a bit. What happens if the baby needs help in between appointments and we don't know. So many questions swirling it's just a sink of not fun.

"Hi all,

long story short our 4 month vaccinations were delayed a month as she was unwell at the time, getting three injections at this sitting.  In the days prior she had got into a good routine of only waking once or at most twice a night after a long period of being very difficult.

Unfortunately it seems these have knocked her for six, we managed the fever in the two days after but since then she HATES sleep, like seems to actually fear it or potentially have bad dreams?  She's exhausted but will cry like a maniac for an extended period of time if you try to put her down.  If miracles behold and she falls asleep, she will jolt awake in around 15mins.

"Hi all. 
First time poster on this sub, and on mobile. We follow attachment parenting, did blw, baby signing, and extended breastfeeding.

We have a 20 month old (almost 21) and are due with another in less than 14 weeks.  She has been night weaned since 15 months and completely weaned at 18 months. She bedshared from 4 months to 16 months, and still as needed (bad allergy days, teething, nightmares).  We have a good routine of bath, pjs, teeth, stories, prayers, songs and rocking to sleep. 

She takes a 1 to 2 hour nap around noon (after lunch) each day. It takes 10 to 15 mins for her to go down. Averages 90 mins asleep. We also try to get her to the playground for 30 to 45 mins each day. On cold or rainy days, we try to find an indoor playplace (She signs play at chick fil a now). 

Up until about 2 weeks ago, LO 1 was doing great sleeping in her own bed most nights through the night. She did, and still does, wake between 7 and 8 each morning.

 She stayed at my just yes parents overnight when we went to SO's company party. We are trying to have her stay once a month to get used to it before LO2 arrives and she stays for 2 nights. While there, she stayed up until around 1130, (normally asleep by 8/830 with routine starting by 730). She ended up bed sharing with my parents rather than sleep on her bed there. Her great grandma was also in the room, so I'm not surprised. Since then, she won't go to sleep before 9 most nights and she's woken up every night and come into our bed. Most nights are between 2 and 4 am,  but it's been as early as 11pm. I bought and started reading the No Cry Sleep Solution For Toddlers and Preschoolers, but it's been misplaced in the holiday cleanup. 

We need her back in her room before April. She's in a toddler bed since I can't lean over a crib side easily. Her coming to our bed bothers SO more than me, but LO1 will be holding on to him and pet his arm for a long time in her sleep. It drives him nuts. I have my back to her because pregnancy left side sleeping.

Suggestion for resources? Please be supportive. I know we messed up by not putting her down drowsy and awake as a tiny baby,  but we could never find that window as first time parents. 

Sorry it's so long.

"Hi everyone, I recently found this sub. I write behavioral/academic/social/life-skills programs to assist adults and children with special needs in reaching their individual goals. I teach and supervise staff on implementing these interventions.

I also have this postpartum edema that’s crazy!!!! Worse than when I was pregnant even!!! I can barely walk to the bathroom. 

I slept 9 hours total in 5 days so I am  exhausted. 

My body wasn’t producing milk fast enough and we had to use formula..... I breast fed her literally all day Wednesday that by Thursday morning... she needed more and her little cry of hunger killed me. 

Now, I had to move on to pumping to see what I can even get and feed her formula but now little girl wants to eat almost every hour or hour and a half so I don’t know if my poor nipples can handle that and I am barely producing anything much less what she’s been eating every hour!!

She also does this all night so my husband and I are zombies.

"Hi! I've been lurking here for a while,  and I'm going to do a combo introduction / question post I suppose. If you want to skip to the main question,  just read the tl;dr at the bottom of this.  

I'm a young mom (early 20s) who has been ridiculed by my family for not breastfeeding. I got off of my medication (wellbutrin and ativan) when I became pregnant,  and quit cold turkey by choice at 4 weeks pregnant.  It has been hellish, but my baby is perfectly healthy in my tummy and that's what matters for now.  My depression and anxiety have spiraled into something dark and nasty, and Im getting back on my medication immediately post partum,  because it worked well for me and I'm at a high risk for PPD (although I don't know if that's the proper term for it considering it's been constant depression for a decade now,  and not really related to my pregnancy).

 Of course,  I can't breastfeed on these medications, but I have been through countless ssris and wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that helps me stay motivated alert ect. My family has been saying things like my kid will be obese, stupid,  have asthma, and I should just get over it and be a good mom who doesn't need pills.... Seriously.  I can't even get out of bed,  have gained close to 70 lbs,  and.... Yeah.  I can't be a good mom in this state.  I know I don't have to excuse myself,  I just wanted to give a little background I suppose. 

My son is due in 2 weeks.  
I have 3 pura kiki stainless steel bottles (they're pretty expensive,  but I like the idea of them so I got 3) , and one glass bottle.  I'm curious as to if this will be enough, or how many bottles people normally have. I feel like it's a small amount, but the other part of me doesn't want a million unwashed bottles around (we live with my in laws,  and they're.... Weird about anything we own being visible in their kitchen / anywhere but my bedroom). having just a few will help me keep on top of cleaning / drying them right away.  I don't know.  I have no idea what I'm doing at all,  and I'm just looking for some anecdotes I guess.

"I am a FTM and new pumper. I bought the Medala Harmony manual pump last week for the purpose of building my supply, freezing and having a few ounces in the fridge for emergencies. 

I was just wondering what others schedules/systems are in hopes of better streamlining my own. At the moment I am pumping at night after Little Bug goes to bed and can only produce about 2 oz. Little Bug has been sleeping through the night starting at 10pm and waking around 7am. During the day I feed on demand but will not let her go beyond 2 hours between feedings. This is mainly due to her doctor expressing a little concern at her 2 month checkup with regards to her weight gain. She didn't lose weight but she averaged around 14 oz a week while the doctor said she would like her to be around 20-25 oz a week.

I figured I would start pumping a little after each feeding but I'm a little inundated with the cleaning that is required. It's not that big of a deal but it is a little time consuming. After each pumping session I break down the pump and clean in hot water with soap. At the end of the day I sterilize. Rinse, lather, repeat.

So share your wisdom ladies!

"I don't know if this is the right place for this, maybe I should shuffle on over to /r/offmychest...  But here it goes.

I have two, beautiful, healthy, young children.  I'm a stay at home mom to a 33 month old boy and a 5.5 month old girl.  Our last year has been tough and stressful - I had a difficult pregnancy, and we sold our house and moved to a new area.  We've been in our new house for 3 weeks and we're adjusting to living very close to family.

My mother is an occupational therapist who works with pre-school and school aged children in schools and my MIL is a pre-school teacher.  It's not like I don't have resources and people who care. 

When my son went to his 2 year Dr. appointment they said that I should come back at 2.5 if he wasn't ""talking more"".  But at 2.5 he WAS talking ""more"", and there was so much else going on that I didn't make time to go back specifically for him.  Additionally, all along my mother has said that he's doing GREAT - not just ""okay"" or ""fine"", but ""GREAT"".  She's always extremely impressed with him and constantly picking her jaw up off the floor after he shows off yet another skill.  

When I took my newborn in for her 3 month visit, I inquired with the pediatrician about my son.  I told her he still wasn't talking conversationally... that he was certainly talking MORE.... But.... 

The pediatrician referred me to early intervention.  Between my mother and my MIL, I am no stranger to early intervention and I'm aware that it's a great resource.  But we were 3 weeks away from moving!  So I waited till we moved into our new house to call local early intervention services.  They arranged a visit and it took another 3 weeks for the evaluation to actually take place.

It took place this morning.

Allow me to give you the following background:  He knows his alphabet cold (in order, and out of order), he knows the phonics sounds, he knows how to write all the letters, and he can read a significant number of words.  He can write all his numbers, count objects, and count (by himself) to 100.  He knows his colors, his shapes (including rhombus, pentagon, hexagon and octagon).  He knows animals and their sounds.  He's sweet and he's affectionate.  He just doesn't converse with me.

The early intervention people were lovely.  They were kind and clear and helpful.  The evaluation went okay I guess, but it was clear he failed a number of things on the standardized test that I know he can do -- but it wasn't a surprise to me that he ignored requests or refused to do things when asked.  He always has his own agenda. 

Basically he's delayed.  Significantly delayed.  Socially delayed. Enough so that he easily qualifies for early intervention services and therapies.  Speech and general Teacher therapy.  I leaped at the offer of help and he should start treatment in less than 14 days.  We're going to get him to work on back and forth interaction. 

But I'm a fucking mess. I feel like curling into a fetal ball in a corner somewhere and bawling for hours.  I've started a couple of times, but if I really let it go, I'm not sure I could calm myself down. 

I know my mom is going to call me later on today to find out how it went.  I know my MIL is going to stop by on her way home from pre-school to talk to me about how it went.  A friend of mine has already IMed me 10 minutes ago to ask how it went.

I don't want to talk about it.  I feel like a failure.  I feel like this has got to be my fault.  

I will fucking take care of this, you know? I will seek out and accept help and  I will work on it.  I will woman the fuck up and address this as head on as I am capable.  

But I am so heartbroken in this moment that it is hard to breathe.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"But she kept asking me how I would bring him back and bring him back home.

My mother was such a professional."
"I don't know what I want lately. I'm a mom to 11 month old twins and a research coordinator at a university. I returned to work at 10 weeks and they started daycare (no family nearby). It worked really well for us and I was elated to be back at work. I loved the interaction, feeling valued at work, having time to eat my lunch, being able to run an errand on the way home from work, etc. We had a lot of illnesses over the winter (RSV, HFM, ear infections, etc.), and while that was exhausting, I knew that is par for the course with daycare and it didn't really phase me.

However, lately I'm feeling frustrated with daycare- just the fact that my babies don't have as much time outside, are given way more ""junk"" snacks than we give at home, etc. Naturally, daycare does things differently than how I would do things and this hasn't bothered me previously, but it has been bothering me lately.

I approached my boss about changing my schedule a bit and to my surprise, he was very accommodating and supportive. I now work in the office 11-5/5:30 and at home from 7-9ish at night. This allows me to have mornings to hang out with the babies, do some cleaning around the house, or go for a run. I am SO grateful that I have such a supportive work environment. However, lately, I'm just feeling so burned out. Even with my new schedule, there's always so much to juggle and I definitely have the guilt of not spending more time with my babies. I toy with the idea of quitting my job, but I worry that quitting my job would royally screw over my future employment prospects, make our finances tighter than what I'm comfortable with, and isolate me.

"I have a two year old and my four year old that I adopted a few months ago. She has been living with me on and off since birth and consistantly since she was 18 months old. There was a period of time where her biological mother chose not to see her for an entire year. 

Speaking of her mother, she is a drug addict. She has six children and has custody of none of them. About a year ago she gave birth to yet another drug addicted baby and CPS took all six of her kids. I hired a lawyer and proved that she had been living with me all this time and she was placed in my care. Her case was closed within months. Three of her siblings were placed with their grandmother (who actually has no relation to the children but helped raise their bio mom) and the other two with their father. Her grandmother made it clear that she wanted custody of her and that she would be better off living with her. Which is funny to me because not only does my daughter not even know her, her grandmother hasn't seen her in years. She hasn't called to ask about her or anything. All of a sudden that these kids bring in money and she cares about them (I believe she gets $1,200 a month for the three she has). 

Anyway, a while ago I decided I wanted to adopt her. I spoke to her bio mom (my sister) about it and she agreed and even asked why I didn't do this sooner. I paid over $1,000 for a home study, got a mental and physical examination, and basically proved to the court that my fiancé and I are responsible and financially able to support her. I adopted my daughter in February of this year.

Sorry I'm rambling. But the point is, whenever I bring her around her family and they hear her calling me mom they correct her and tell her that I'm her aunt. They also tell her that my two year old is not her sister. I've explained to my daughter the whole situation and she understands that she didn't come from my belly like her sister did, she came from someone else's. But it pisses me off that they tell her these things. I feel like they're trying to put her against me like I somehow did her wrong. They don't seem to realize that I saved her from years of abuse and neglect that her siblings went through (I made many CPS reports and all 7 cases got closed without them ever doing anything). They don't realize that she never had to recover from the issues her bio siblings are dealing with now. I don't even know what to do at this point.

"I have an aggressive bone cancer that has recently spread to my lungs. Treatment is ongoing and we’re remaining positive that I can survive the disease. 

However, we have had to talk to my 6 year old daughter about my illness and she has asked will I die. I answered her as sensitively as I could without telling a barefaced lie. I said I didn’t think that I would die and I am hoping to get better, but that yes I might well die. 

She cried a bit and then, naturally, asked ‘what happens when you die?’ My wife has already had discussions like this with her where she talked about how our body becomes part of the world/universe again. She seemed happy with this explanation and she knows that other people have differing beliefs. Discussing death hypothetically and facing the possibly imminent death of your dad are a little different though. And I’m just not sure what to say. I want to give her some comfort, but I’m not about to say that I’ll see her in heaven when I just don’t believe that. She’s the absolute apple of my eye and we have a very special relationship. 

I guess I’m asking for general advice on how to answer these questions. Anything beyond a ‘I don’t know’ seems a little deceptive as of course I don’t, but it  isn’t terribly comforting to a little girl who might lose her daddy.

"I have literally not been around a child learning to read since I was 16 years old, and I definitely did not pay any attention to it at that age. I'm just really confused regarding exactly HOW other people teach their children to read. What actually works?

I have a 6 year old (7 in June) in first grade. He has never been in public school. Teaching him how to read has been ... Not easy. I've tried phonics, which was probably the most successful at actually getting him started.. He knows all of the phonics rules and he's great at sounding out words that use those rules. 

But he's really lacking in the sight word area.. And in fluency in general. He has issues remembering sight words. And while he's reading, he will stop and sound out every flipping word. Like ""has"" which he has read 1,000 times so far. He still stops and sounds it out even though he should know it on sight. He will stop and say h-a-s, has. Which obviously hinders reading fluency. I've told him that if he knows the word, he doesn't need to sound it out. But he acts as if he has to sound it out.

Also with other words he has read previously in the same lesson, he often won't remember them when they are repeated. He also has a bad habit of  guessing at words. Often when reading a sentence, he will read the words correctly the first time, and then at the end we read the sentence again (more fluently), and he will guess at the words and read them incorrectly (likely because he's just trying to repeat from memory without actually paying attention to the words that he's reading because he just wants to finish and do other things). 

He also just hates his lessons in general. And sometimes I feel like he misreads words on purpose just to fish for an answer from me. He can't read independently at all. I'm pretty sure he's behind, and I want to fix that.

I'd just like something simple that I can implement to get out of this rocky place that we're in and get him to actually read words on sight with fluency and catch up to where he should be.

Just a note - I don't want to drop money on a program. I'm not interested in buying curriculum, workbooks, or anything else. I'm not looking for product suggestions.

I'm only looking for a strategy to successfully teach him how to read. Something i can do with books / printer / paper / things I already own.. Or free online resources.

"I have pumped a few times already, but when I do pump I've pumped it all from both breasts so I have some milk in the fridge if I have to go somewhere and my mom watches him while I'm out. 

I guess my question is should I pump it all or should I just pump a certain amount? There was one night I pumped a few hours before going to bed and I didn't have enough to feed him so I had to warm up what I had pumped earlier that night. I want to start getting a small stash, but when I pump it just seems like there isn't enough there for him to eat later when he's awake and hungry.

Was it because it's was only like a week and a half after he was born and my milk is still catching up to what he eats? Should I just pump one boob at a time every time I go to pump so he has at least one boob to eat from? The latter seems like the best choice I guess and I just now thought of it...go me just now thinking of it -_-

"I have some questions for any moms that had to switch over to EPing either you EPed since the beginning or gave up breastfeeding to EP, I'm having some thoughts about switching over, more than likely temporarily. I was previously only breastfeeding twice a day and then pumping 7 times (I was doing 8, but had to cut down due to exhaustion). I'm having to supplement due to a low supply of milk. Yesterday I went to a private LC to talk to about my supply, we did a weighted feed and my baby only got 1.8oz total from both breasts (she told me 2oz, but every milliliter counts) she said my baby could get more and told me I was going great and supply was good, that my baby was tired, she was right, this time. She was fussy for the next 2 hours, she had to be burped and was tired, that's fine. Today I tried to follow her advice, to primarily breastfeed and pump after when baby was sleeping, and today I realized why I had to supplement. I breastfeed her for about 20 minutes, then let her nurse to sleep twice. She woke up 20 minutes later while I was pumping, fussing for an hour until I realized she was hungry. She was starving. I gave her a 3oz bottle and she drank it so fast, it just solidified that my supply wasn't up to par with her. I was told to breastfeed, supplement as needed and then pump, I've tried that already and was told on a previous post to drop one because I am exhausted. I felt as if I was doing better by her by just pumping, even though I know she gets more out of me, but not knowing how much she's getting is anxiety inducing and being home alone trying to breastfeed only for her to wake up screaming 20 minutes later, knowing I'll have to pump, it's exhausting. I just want to pump, probably breastfeed at least twice a day, until I can see my supply is actually rising so I dont have to scramble to supplement. I know I should have a bottle ready, I know that, I normally do, but it's also nice being able to hand her over to my husband or MIL for a feeding. My question, or rather questions, to you ladies, is what made you change to EPing, how do you handle that and child care? Do you have any tips to make it easier?

"I just wanna know how typical this is. For my morning pump (1/2 hour after breastfeeding at least) I am getting 5 oz of milk out of my right boob and about 2 oz of milk out of my left boob. My baby is only 2 weeks old + 5 days and well back above his birth weight so I am more than producing enough overall for him. He seems to be satisfied no matter which side he eats from and gets milk drunk and sleepy from either side. 

I am just wondering how typical that wide of a disparity is between boobs? I can fill an entire bottle with my right boob and only 2oz with the other.. it just seems strange to me.  

I am trying to get him to nurse the left side more and I will start to pump more frequently on the left side. I kind of only have been pumping when my boobs are engorged (so in the morning, before bed, sometimes in the middle of the night somewhere if I wake up in pain).

"I just want somewhere to let this out where people won't think I'm bonkers for doing what we're doing. Additional stories, advice, whatever is welcome. Negative judgement isn't. 

I have two kids, 5 and 2 and I'm growing a third. Just over a year ago we moved into my parent's ground level suite. It's been a great arrangement for all of us. The only downside is that there's only 1 (large) bedroom for my family of nearly 5. My big kid is in a twin bed on his own and the 2yo, hubby and myself are on queen+twin mattresses on the floor. 

Up until tonight the 2yo started the night on the twin then would come into the queen for snuggles around midnight and stay there. I'm getting to the point in pregnancy where it's getting more difficult to crawl out of my 10"" of space between hubby and toddler to go pee without waking everyone. Plus once baby comes I won't be able to do all the toddler snuggling as well as all the night nursing for the baby.

The plan is for me to sleep on the twin with the baby (it's a firmer mattress) and the toddler to sleep in the queen with hubby partly because she hasn't indicated any interest in sleeping on her own and partly because we have nowhere else to put her. Tonight is the first night of the transition. She's already woken once (10pm) and hubby snuggled her then she crawled away to find me so I half snuggled her at the edge of the bed and scooted back over to the twin once she was out. 

This is going to be as hard on her as it will be on me. We've got 3 months for this transition so plenty of time. But she's my baby.

"I just wanted to write this to encourage you ladies who might be having doubts about your doctor or maybe just aren't as comfortable with them as you'd like to be. 

When I found out I was pregnant I went to my ob/gyn who I had only seen once or twice before since we moved here a couple of years ago. She was fine at my regular check ups but upon my first prenatal visit, I started to feel uncomfortable. First off, her nurse asked me if I was having morning sickness and when I said yes, immediately gave me a prescription for Zofran. I wasn't even throwing up and I didn't ask for medicine but she just automatically assumed I should take it. This rubbed me the wrong way.

I had a C-section with my first child 10 years ago but I had done my research and knew I was a good candidate for a VBAC. When I told the Dr. that I would like to try for a natural birth this time, she literally scoffed at me. Then she proceeded to tell me about the times she had done VBACs where they hadn't gone as planned and that when your uterus ruptures, it looks like a ""war zone"".

I left my first appointment feeling uneasy and unsupported. And then I decided, there is no way I'm letting this lady share in one of the most intimate moments of my life, much less be knee deep in my hoohah.

I Googled doctors in my area who were supportive of natural childbirth and called the first one I found. I met with her and my experience was amazingly different.  No automatic assumption that I needed drugs, total support of my desire to do this naturally, and more than willing to answer all of my questions. In short, I LOVE her.

I'm now 31 weeks and met with her today. I asked her about my concerns with episiotomies, ie not wanting one unless absolutely necessary, and about not cutting the imbilical cord right away. She was already on board. 

I had some self doubt at first about switching. I thought maybe I was being too picky or uptight, but I am SO glad I went with my instinct and switched.

"I know this is a sensitive topic that fires people up but I’d love to get some opinions. 

I took 2 sleep classes when I had a newborn, did everything they said, was going pretty well, but then at 3.5 months old all hell broke loose and nights were out of control bad. I was losing my mind I was so sleep-deprived and started co-sleeping out of desperation after 2.5 hellish months of nightly battled. Now she’s 8 months old and is still a terrible sleeper and I’m just at a loss. When we lay her down in her crib for the night she only sleeps for 1-2 hours before waking up. And if we’re successful at laying her back down we get 30 mins at the most before she wakes again. And naps are only maybe 45 mins IF she even lets us lay her down without waking up and crying. If I hold her she’ll sleep for 2+ hours. 

So my question is - do you think sleep training (and by that I obviously mean letting her cry - a little, a lot, idk) is inevitable? I’m at such a loss. I never wanted to do that (not that I judge anyone who does! I just wanted to avoid it and it just doesn’t seem like something I’ll be able to stomach), but I’m so tired and her dad is frustrated and acts like I created this problem (I promise you I didn’t initially, though I definitely realize to finally get some sleep after 5.5months we did resort to some bad sleep associations but honestly I had no choice if I wanted to continue to function).

"I love my husband, but I'm disappointed about his lack of support when with our toddler.  Before we had a kid, he insisted that he would do half the childcare work, but he does more like 5-10%.  He can't really seem to handle any criticism of his lack of help.  Anytime I've brought it up, he gets super defensive and angry.  This makes him sound bad but he's not a jerk in general and he does do a reasonable amount of housework (although we have a housekeeper who does the majority of it).  I know he loves our kid, so I'm not exactly sure why he's not willing to put in more time caring for her.  It's almost like it's just not in his nature to go-with-the-flow and follow around a toddler.  And he did even less when she was an infant.  It's hard now too, because I'm clearly her favorite parent by far.  I mean, she almost never even says ""dada"".  She learned our dog's name before ""dada"".

I'm a bit worried that our marriage might not survive a second kid.  Although, now that I know what to expect, I think it will be way less devastating emotionally than the first time around.

"I posted several months ago struggling with cloth and got so many helpful comments. I was really touched by how many people gave advice so I wanted to update and say thank you all!

Right after the post we were gifted several months worth of disposable diapers and we moved to a new washer so we took a break.

We’ve been back in cloth two weeks and everything is going great! I wanted to share what changed in case anyone else is struggling with it.

My main issues and how I fixed them:

1. Smell. I was following Fluff Love and trying to create a large “stew.” It was way too much cloth in one load and not enough water. I was also using too much detergent. Basically the diapers were simply not clean. My routine now is so simple. I wash my diapers just like regular laundry but I do a regular cycle followed by an extra heavy cycle. So easy and my diapers smell great. 

2. Fluff bum. When my son was so itty bitty the fluff bum looked big enough that it bothered me. Now that’s he’s bigger and crawling it looks much more balanced and as a bonus it gives him a nice padded seat!

3. Clothing. I still can’t pull off onesies without causing leaks. But that’s also been improved with age - shirts stay on him and fit better now and the simple diaper + shirt combo is so easy for changes and also adorable.

"I really don’t know exactly why I’m making a post about this other than I’m seriously lonely at the moment and I just wish things had gone differently tonight. 

Everything was fine. My husband got off work around five, got home around six as usual. Him any our one year old daughter played and let me rest. I haven’t been feeling very well the past couple days. It was nice to be able to lay/sit around for a bit. Around seven is always dinner time. My husband and little girl almost always share dinner since he eats a ton and she loves everything he makes. 

This is where things took a quick turn. My little girl had chili  and noodles all over her hands (one of my husbands special recipes haha). She came over to me. I was sitting on the couch in a very freshly cleaned blanket. I didn’t want chili on the couch or blanket. I know I probably shouldn’t worry much about that but I really take pride in my home being clean. So, when she walked over to me I said “No no no no no. Take it to your daddy,” I said it in a normal but stern tone. Nothing out of the ordinary but a bit quicker than I normally would. 

Well it scared my baby girl. I felt terrible and wasn’t sure what to do. During this my husband is saying how I scared her and I didn’t have to be that way. He also asked me to make her something else since I scared her away from his food. So I did. I made her more food and cleaned her up. Once the food was done she was sitting with my husband and he was feeding her again. So in the end she wasn’t hungry for what I made her. 

I tried to talk to my husband about him making me feel bad for messing up and he really didn’t have much to say so I just gave in and sat silently until he got her ready for bed and I told her goodnight, giving her kisses and wishing I could go back and not scare her like I did. 

I’m not mad. I never was with my husband. I was hurt by how he acted after. I just made a small mistake and I’m so upset over it. I would do anything to take him back. I just need reassurance from him but I didn’t get that. 

Don’t get me wrong at all. He is an amazing husband and an even better father. I love him so much. I could never image being away from him. 

And now I’m in bed. Without him. Not out of anger. He had a couple beers too quick and also from working all day he just fell asleep in his chair. I tried to get him to come to bed but he wanted to stay there for a little while. Now I’m lonely and can’t stop thinking about it all.

"I see comments from parents of multiples a lot on social media, frustrated with others asking if their boy/girl twins are identical.  On the surface, it may sound like a stupid question, but the reality is, its not as stupid as many think.  The reality is, identical twins CAN be male/female.

There is a genetic condition called [Turner Syndrome](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/turner-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20032572) in which after conception, the X/Y sex gene is mysteriously lost.  This results in a zygote with only a single X gene which will develop to be female.  

In the case of identical twins, it is possible for an XY zygote to split into male identical twins, whereas later the Y gene is lost in one of them.  The result is an XY male and an X female with Turner Syndrome.

Turner Syndrome is not all that uncommon, it happens in ~ 1 in 2,500 births.  But due to the rarity of identical twins, it is exponentially rare with them.

"I think this post is mostly a win, with a few sucky things combined.

So since SD13 came back from 10 day visit with BM things have been a rollercoaster. I always delete my previous posts because they usually include too much identifying info.. so to summarize the past weeks events: SD13’s BM has only 19/days a year custody after she moved far away (lost custody 3.5 years ago due to domestic violence and alcoholism) didn’t see SD for 7 months, didn’t talk to her for months until forced by the court. Last week she came back for her first longer than 48 hr visit with BM in 3.5 years and she said she wanted to live with BM. (BM has done a lot of messed up crap.)

Anyways it was a hard week for me and my DH. A child saying they want to live with the other parent is the last thing you want to hear if the other parent has nothing but awful, left the child, and hurt the child, has not provided for the child in years, when the other parent has costed us $80.000+ in attorney fees just to keep SD safe. And then to find out 10 days with BM was all it took, yep it sucked. 

After SD13 told me straight to my face she doesn’t care what her BM did to her, that she lied to me about everything she told me about her BM (I try really hard to not say a bad thing about BM, but SD was always talking crap on BM and I was there to comfort her.) I backed off completely, I made her food, that was about it, I wasn’t mean, I just kinda went into my room more, or just left the house, I was hurt.

My DH talked to our attorney, he said to not let her live with BM since we knew that wouldn’t be in the best interest, but to offer more time since BM will get more time in January anyways. We came to find out BM doesn’t want her to live there anyways, she wants SD just enough so she won’t have to pay child support, and that we have to pay her child support (she only needs 20% custody to get child support from us).. so that was out of the window. We offered another week later this summer to BM, she took that.

SD came to my DH a couple days ago and told him that she didn’t actually want to live with BM. I didn’t find this out until last night, DH said SD had told him she would tell me, but she didn’t. But that’s okay. 

A couple days ago and not really having any communication with SD and finally having calmed down, I just kinda sucked it up and decided to be an adult and took her to the movies. It was a movie me and her have been talking about for weeks. We had a good time.

From there things went back to normal. I didn’t hear a word about BM anymore. She was hugging, kissing me again and telling me she loved me. She came and hung out with me again. DH called BM and they settled on a week in August. 

Well now we know for the future, she just needed time to adjust to coming back home from BM and to probably just be patient. This was the first time we had to deal with this so it was tough for all of us. But now we know.

The sad part is, BM has been telling SD and her half sister (different dad) for weeks that she’s coming down this month for SD’s half sister’s dance recital. Both of them are excited BM was coming down to see them.. well as expected, BM has now said to my DH that she’s not coming.. we haven’t told SD yet, but I’m sure she’ll be upset. 

Bonus wins: yesterday SD13 came to me talking about tampons (lol) she’s always said that she will NEVER wear them. Until yesterday morning when she started a heavy period right on 4th of July when she was gonna go swimming. Her BM doesn’t even know she has started her period yet, despite having it for 1.5 years. SD doesn’t want her to know because BM posts that kind of stuff on Instagram (yes really) and SD is terrified of that, I’m the only one she will talk to about it.

"I tried asking this in beyondthebump but maybe this group will have more insight.
**Request –** Any moms who almost exclusively breastfeed ~1.5 yrs that have any tips for feeding your kid enough during the day so kiddo doesn't wake up 3x a night to eat. Or any moms out there deal with an oral SPD that have any tips!?! Or transition tips from breastfeeding to my pumping and a cup??

**Background:** I love my daughter (19mths almost exclusively breastfed) she is amazing &amp; hitting all her milestones; however, she struggles with eating solids.
When she was born I wanted to try breastfeeding but was open to formula, if needed, but she took to breastfeeding really well. She started eating purees at 6 months. However, around 9 months she started rejecting all purees but she started to love the meltables and other easy foods. I thought maybe she just didn’t like purees as much as the other foods so didn’t think too much of it – a phase. 

At 12 months, her classmates were all eating a variety of foods and she’d only eat crunchy items like crackers/cheerios. So we made an appointment for her to get assessed and she has been diagnosed with an oral sensory processing disorder. She is now almost 19 months and progress is slow. I’m grateful she is still healthy and growing well as we are still breastfeeding. She has been doing OT (messy play to get used to touching and working our way up to eating) and Speech Therapy (to work on her chewing etc as she only has 4 teeth and tends to let food melt instead of chewing). We just met with a dietitian to try and figure out what she eats and how we can move forward from breastfeeding.

I’m STRUGGLING. I know some folks love breastfeeding and the WHO recommends until 2 yrs but I really didn’t think I’d be going this long. I didn’t mind it but this last month has just been – ENOUGH. I want to be done for my sanity. Around 12 months she used to drink pumped milk or formula (when I wasn't available) but I don’t know what happened as she won’t take any formula (different brands or flavors mixed with different milks/water) or even my breast milk in cups or bottles (I’ve been trying so many types). I’m so frustrated and dad tries – he does! But she’ll throw tantrums and won’t drink anything but water until I come home. The pressure of making sure I can always feed her is heavy.

My husband had noticed I have been withdrawing the past couple of weeks so he is trying harder to acknowledge my struggles and it’s helping my sanity but I just don’t know how much longer I can take breastfeeding Additionally, I'm not sure if she is getting enough during the day so she'll wake up 2-3x a night.

"I was hesitant to post this as I was so worried about what people would think of me as a mother but from what I have seen this is a lovely community so here goes.

My daughter has had a lot of health issues since birth and been in and out of hospital and the one thing that would always settle her at night, especially in hospital would be a bottle. 

•She never has bottles through the day and eats plenty.
•I have tried offering warm water instead and she pushes it away and asks for milk.
•I’ve tried totally ignoring her and she will sit up in her cot for hours just sitting there half asleep asking for a bottle therefore making her very tired the next day.
• It doesn’t matter if she doesn’t have a nap in the day or how tired she is, she will still wake up for one.
•She generally has a bottle before bed 19:30-20:00 about 180ml then sometimes she will wake at 00:00 wanting another 90ml and other times she can go through till 04:00 having 90ml and that will be the last one before she wakes up.

It doesn’t bother me getting up and doing this as it takes me less than 5 minutes start to finish and I almost do it in my sleep now I’m so used to it but I understand it isn’t good for her to still have them at night. Also she gets a better night sleep if she has them rather than sitting for hours asking me for one. A few questions if I may;

•How bad is it for her to still be doing this?
•Do you think she will just grow out of it when she is ready?
•Do you think I should just ignore her and eventually she will give up?
•Is this a comfort thing from being so poorly all the time knowing this will get her back to sleep. 

Any suggestions or help would be great, thanks for reading everyone.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"I was reluctant to post this because I was so worried what people would think of me as a mum, but from what I have seen this is such a lovely community. • My daughter has had many health issues since birth and has been in and out of hospital and the one thing she would always sort out at night would be a bottle. • She never pushes bottles through the day and eats a lot. • I tried to push her away and get full milk. • I've tried to ignore her completely and she'll sit in her bed for hours just while she asks for a bottle, which makes her very tired the next day. • It doesn't matter if she doesn't have a nap in the evening or how tired she is, she'll still have a bottle at night just before bed, and it's kind of not part of my life to be against it."

"I'm new to cloth diapering and am trying to figure out diaper bag. I currently carry a Jujube BFF, which I carried for my first kid, who will be 4 years old next month. I don't need much room for him, a handful of small toys, maybe a drink and/or snack cup.

I have a 14 week old that we just started cloth diapering in the last couple weeks. I'm currently doing covers plus prefolds. I have 4 Alva wetbags. I've been putting 1 cover, 2 prefolds, a snappi, and like 4 cloth wipes in the smaller/outer pocket of the wet bag, and dirty stuff in the larger/inner pocket of the wetbag.

Whereas I could fit 5 disposables in one pocket, and the wipes container in another pocket. I now barely have room for anything else. I like to have burp rags, extra changes of clothes, a blanket, nursing cover, small toys...

And that's when I'm carrying the bag. If DH has the baby, he uses stuffed pocket diapers, so even more bulky. And he needs bottles as well.

"I've never wrote here so this will be my first. I'm 18 and I live in New Jersey. Im 6 weeks and 6 days pregnant and as per usual, the father doesn't want to be involved. He's 21. We met in May and started dating at the end of July and I found out about 2 weeks ago that I was pregnant. He use to tell me that he was with whatever decision I made and that we would figure it out. We spoke about it and he knew I wanted to keep the baby but I'm close to his family and his mother kind of talked me into an abortion. It just seemed like it was the right thing to do with me starting college and my living situation. I live at home but I'm currently sleeping on the couch.
I had called to get the abortion pill which My insurance covered so he didn't have to pay a dime or do anything. So I decided that an abortion was not what I wanted after going to NY to get away for a few days with his 2 sisters. I just couldn't go through it. It's a baby and why should it have to pay for our stupidity. I made it very clear to everyone that I wasn't doing this for him but for me. It's my body and if he doesn't want to stick around then fine. That just shows how much of a man he ISNT. I broke up with him cause of how unfair he was being and our relationship wasn't the best because we had rushed into it. Now he's calling me crazy for wanting to keep it because we have only been together a month and a half. He's calling me selfish because he's not ready for a baby. He claims I'm trying to ruin his life. I believe he was just really comfortable in life. He doesn't go to college he works at a small store and claims Im ruining his dreams to be someone. I don't think this baby will ruin my life, it's a blessing to me even though I'm young. But he's making it seem like I got myself pregnant and now he doesn't want to deal with the responsibilities and he doesn't want to be with me because I'm choosing to keep the baby. Which is fine by me, I think he's being a coward. I've already been preparing myself to take care of this child by myself. His sister also thinks I'm stressing him out which is ridiculous and telling me it's my fault for opening my legs to someone I've only been with for a month and a half and his for not pulling out. Like if I'm some whore who sleeps around with different guys at once...He wants me to have an abortion so bad which I just can't do. I wish he or others understood what's it like when you have a life growing inside of you. I feel so attached to this baby already.

"It's doing finger pricks 4 times a day with a blood glucose tester. I much rather this way for several lifestyle reasons, including we only have one car, my husband has to drive me to my appointments anyway because pregnancy makes me carsick, i get spontaneous tummy troubles that are best relieved by laying on the sofa in loose house clothes and using my own bathroom with 100x more privacy than a public toilet (*plus i'm weird about the social pressure to not be in there for more than 3 minutes even if i have layers of clothes to get hung up, plus my bag and a small child who's always with me. Other pregnant people have to use it, too! i just can't relax which makes things worse*), I have two other children, one who is 3 and can't handle hanging out for 3 fucking hours in a waiting room while a nurse makes sure i'm not getting up and walking around while waiting for my turn to get blood drawn and the other is in school, putting pressure on us to schedule everything carefully around getting him or arranging someone to get him, and so, we just plain don't have the 4-5 hours to take out of our day to do this. It's too much for us. Plus i'm just burnt out of getting blood drawn. I don't mind needles but or the actual process but, i don't want to do it anymore because...i'm bratty like that.


So, instead, i was prescribed a glucose monitor test, with lancets (needed to poke your finger), test strips, and even rubbing alcohol pads, and i test first thing in the morning and an hour after every meal and that's it! I set an egg timer as soon as i finish the last bite of my meal, record my results on a chart, and call it a day. for a week or so then turn in my chart.


**The pros**- 1) You can stay at home! That was the most appealing part of this to me. I'm a stay at home mom anyway so, getting a sitter for my daughter so i can go to an appointment is really just money we now don't have to spend. Which is very, very nice. And like i mentioned, finding someone to make sure my elder child is safe after school is now not a problem.

2) you get a monitor out of it. Not the most appealing thing, tbh, but, now you have one and a ton of supplies for it (i got prescribed a month's worth for a week). I don't see a reason to toss it unless i find there's no space for it anymore. Maybe i'll keep tracking my blood sugar sporadically for the rest of my pregnancy just in case. Haven't decided yet.

**The cons**- 1) you have to poke your finger to get blood 4 times a day. The nurse i spoke to was surprised this was a more appealing option to me because most people don't want to poke their fingertips. To me, it's not a big deal. It's slightly painful but goes away quickly thanks to the science of the lancet poker. (i'm not sure what they're called, i refer to it as my ""little bee"" because the lancet looks like a tiny stinger.) it's a 0.5 on a scale of 1-10.

2) an extra trip to the pharmacy and back to the clinic to give them your chart to review. Neither are a problem for me because my husband went to the pharmacy during my appointment (it's in the hospital we use and it's a clusterfuck) and we plan on going ahead and doing a maternity ward tour when we head back to turn in my chart.

"I’m 28 weeks pregnant with my second sweet baby girl. I’m hoping for a VBAC, and have my heart rather set on it. I understand it’s not a certainty, but I want to go into labor on my own and really try. 

I had a checkup with my usual doctor today and asked about it. She “doesn’t have a problem with letting me try for a VBAC”, but she didn’t sound at all encouraging. I asked how far she’d let me go before intervention, and she said 39 weeks. Meaning she’d want to induce in week 39 if I don’t go into labor on my own. Apparently “recent studies of thousands of women” show no increased risk of cesarean when induced in the 39th week. With my first baby’s lack of progression she said that doesn’t look ideal for next time. I asked her if she thought inducing then might have caused the lack of progression, maybe it just wasn’t time. She said at the time she would have agreed, but these “new studies” say otherwise. And that not letting it go to 40 reduces the stress on the baby from pregnancy.... umm, what?

For background: My first was induced, I labored 23 hours, was at 10cm, pushed 2.5, but I got an infection. My fever and baby’s heart rate went up and baby was very high and wouldn’t come down so I had a cesarean birth. I have GD but my weight, blood sugar, blood pressure, everything is all spot on. 

I keep reading how important an on-board provider is, and I’m not getting that. This doctor helped me get pregnant with my first and delivered her, am I crazy to be thinking about a change this late in the game? It makes me very nervous.

"I’m looking for some advice to help get us through this roadblock. My daughter is 2.5 and is almost fully potty trained at home (1, not 2). 

At daycare, she and another girl are working on it. The other girl is more advanced in the process but they are both SUPER EXCITED about going to the bathroom- like it’s a little club that they’re both a part. 

The problem: my daughter is only sitting on the toilet, not releasing. Sometimes she holds it for a few hours at a time, or recently she has been making sure to pee in her pull-up before she gets on the toilet. 

At home, she’s doing all the right things, asking for the potty, manipulating her pull-ups etc. with few accidents. 

I think she has a stage-fright issue and that it makes sense to ratchet down the pressure and let her propose “potty time” but apparently she gets distraught when she’s not brought along for potty time with her friend. 

She seems more excited about the “club” aspect with her friend, than the utility of actually going to the bathroom.

"I’m sure this is going to be a novel full of rambling. But I’m broken right now and need to tell someone besides my husband and our immediate family. 

In July, my husband and I fell in love with a photo and a profile. I know we shouldn’t have. People told us not to, but we did. I called our agency the next morning and asked about the 11 year old girl we saw and read about. Although she could have been anywhere in the state, she lived in the same small town. Her agency was in the building next to ours. Her foster parents caseworker shares an office with our caseworker. We hadn’t spoken to our agency in months. We took time off because I had surgery. But, they were still going to call us that day to tell us about her. 

Everything seemed too perfect. Everything was falling into place. 

We didn’t have our foster license yet, so we sped though everything we still had to do. We interviewed with her caseworker and others at her agency. We were matched. We met her at a matching event. Later her caseworker asked her if she met anyone there that she’d like to get to know. She said us. 

Then we met again, this time she knew who were were. We spent the last month with her. She spent the weekends here. We saw her at least once during every school week. We celebrated Thanksgiving. We painted her room. We decorated for Christmas. We went to her doctors appointments. She woke up in the middle of a nightmare screaming for us. She eventually called me mama. She called my husband daddy. 

I knew it was all too good to be true, but I figured it was the honeymoon phase and once she moved in permanently her behavior would change and we’d finally start to deal with the underlying issues. 

Her foster parents told her caseworker And their caseworker that there weren’t many issues when she wasn’t at our house. There were upticks of past behavior, but nothing major. We talked to her about it. She always admitted to it. 

A few days ago her foster mom finally told her caseworker what’s been happening. She’s been destructive and was having a ton of issues. Worse issues than they’ve seen in the last two years she’s lived with them. 

Her caseworker sat her down to talk to her. They talked for an hour. She didn’t show emotion once. She admitted that she was going along with this to get out of her foster parents house. She thought we were “ok,” but she really didn’t like us. She didn’t want to live with us. Everything was an act. She’s known her caseworker since she was a baby. Her caseworker was sobbing. She didn’t show emotion once.

The last month there wasn’t one sign that she was making everything up. There wasn’t one second that would make us think this was an act. She was on 100% of the time. We’ve racked our brains and nothing makes sense. There were no clues. 

He caseworker is confused too. She had no idea. She thought they were close and had built a good relationship thought the years. Whenever she talked to her she seemed so happy and talked about how glad she is to finally have a family. She expressed sadness about her birth family and how she was changing schools. All the normal things. She never let on that there was such an underlying issue. 

We’re broken. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to pick up these pieces. I don’t know where to start. I feel like I’m drowning. 

Now there’s this bizarre month of my life where I was a “mom.” Where my husband was a “dad.” There was a month were our parents were finally “grandparents.” 

To most people (people we know, not the people on here who have been effected by adoption and/or foster care in someway) it might seem like there’s nothing to grieve. We were never parents. We were just getting to know a child. 

I miss her so much. But there’s no one to miss. We didn’t really know her. Half of me misses her so much I ache. 

I’m mad at myself for falling in love with her. I should have been guarded. The other half of me is so angry at myself for falling for this. I feel like an idiot.

"I’ve been wondering a lot about if midwifery care was a bad fit for me, if I’m just being overly sensitive, or if I had a bad midwife but the model of care could still fit my needs. 
I went into labour at about eleven at night. Regular contractions that got closer together, small amount of blood with each one. After six hours I wasn’t coping with the pain well anymore, and had my husband dial our midwife. 
She and I talked for a while on the phone. She was mainly interested in if my water had broken (no), and if I had an urge to bear down (no).  She suggested I take Tylenol. I tried explaining a few times that the pain was too intense. Finally she suggest that I take two Tylenol, and try to sleep, and that she would call me in an hour and maybe head over for a home check based on how I was doing. 
At that point I just gave up on her, and said sure, and hung up. I told my husband we were going to the hospital. 
He was pretty bewildered that we weren’t following her advice, and insisted on calling her on the way to let her know. I was in too much pain and had pretty much given up on her as a resource to care, and just let him talk to her. She was polite but clearly disappointed, and said she would call ahead so that they would expect us. 
When I arrived at the hospital the nurses treated me like I was being dramatic. I had to jump through a few hoops to get my cervical check, at which it was discovered I only had a lip of the cervix left. 
I remember my nurse saying she had to go call my midwife so she knew to come, leading me to believe she had told them I wasn’t actually in labour and she hadn’t been planning on coming for awhile. 
I obviously missed my epidural window. I received gas and air, but it didn’t manage my pain and was eventually turned off. 
I was told not to push. My midwife came. It hurt so bad not to push, and I feel like that went on forever. Finally I couldn’t not push, and managed to say that I couldn’t not push. They just said, oh that’s fine, you should be pushing. 
The water had meconium in it, and they asked me to start adding extra pushes after each contraction. Obviously hurt like the dickens, and I’m wondering if running around and doing paperwork while in transition and not pushing when I should have been made it necessary. 
When we talked about pain relief we saw a paper with a ladder of pain relief. I said I was fine with all of it if necessary, and it was made to sound like it wouldn’t be an issue, but when I was in labour begging for drugs they just said there was nothing they could do. 
The other thing is that I had pretty bad tearing and eventually a surgeon was called in to do the stitching. There was a stark difference between the surgeon and my midwife. She had been poking around for a while before she made the call to bring in the surgeon, and every poke hurt a lot. I didn’t want to hold my baby because I thought the pain might make me drop him. 
The surgeon instantly froze me, and it made things so much more bearable. The surgeon also acknowledged my pain and explained what was happening, which also helped immensely. 
I ended up seeing discharge papers, where it said I had a precipitous labour. When I looked up the meaning of that, it said a birth under three hours. I feel completely ignored, because my birth was not under three hours. 
Is this normal?  Were we just a bad fit?

"I’ve heard a million times, “reach out for support.” But what does that mean when you don’t have family or (close) friends nearby?

"I’ve previously posted about my son and some behavioral issues he was having in this sub. Luckily, those have subsided and he is now back to his happy, helpful self. 

The only reoccurring issue is that my son will not in any way shape or form accept food thicker than baby food and has not since birth. We’ve taken him to occupational and speech therapy, feeding teams, and other specialists over the years who have all given various versions of the same solutions and none of them have taken. 

We found out a couple of years ago his tonsils had been swollen for a long time and he got them removed when he was 6. He had previous to the surgery always choked on his food because of his lack of knowledge and chewing/size of his tonsils and we thought afterward he would get better. Wrong. Then we started to see it as a psychological issue of him associating food with choking. So of course we took him to a psychologist, also didn’t work. 

Now, I’ve been giving all of these things a long go, months or years of time, multiple at once or dedicating time to one. He does have his school that would need to accommodate the changes and he sees his father’s grandparents for 1.5 days every weekend who have been helpful but often give him a little more leniency. 

At this point my husband keeps saying that since he can’t keep weight on (he’s almost 9 and can’t get above 50 lbs) we will have to put him on a feeding tube. I know he’s most likely right and that terrifies me for my son. I don’t think that it would have the, “okay, I’ll eat effect”, that my husband does. 

Is there anyone out there with anymore suggestions or that has been in the same situation with their child and anything that has worked for you?

"I’ve read pretty much all of the tongue tie posts in several subs, but curious to see if I’ll get any other information here.

"Little background: officially speaking I have the ""every other weekend"" visitation deal with my son, but in reality I get to see him more often than that because his mom and I are on relatively good terms. He's only 16 months old, by the way.

EDIT: Well, some time has passed and circumstances have changed. I was originally looking to move in with my best friend not only because it would have been cheaper, but because post-divorce I was in a pretty bad way and didn't think I should be living alone. It's been nearly a year since the split however (and about six months since my buddy and I have started looking for places), and I think I'm ok enough to handle it. So my buddy and I talked it over and eventually agreed to go our separate ways in terms of living arrangements.

"Little history.  

When my kids were born I was a fundamentalist christian and damn near a theocracy advocate. Nearly 8 years later, I'm an atheist and an anarchist. 

I have found that over the years many bigotted things have come out of my mouth in front of my kids.  That caused some damage in the way they view the world over time.

When I went back to visit my home town I met up with them again and they said they could tell a difference.  What I first thought was ""OMG if they could tell, how bad must it have been for my kids?""

In short they are still young and should be able to over come it.  but I fear I am woefully inept at it and end up just telling them not to think that way, which is wrong and they know it is wrong and call me on it.

"My 4wk old has suddenly started crying during feeds. My mum said it’s wind so we’ve been burping mid feed (he’s EBF).

He really struggles to burp and express gas from the other end. At times he looks like he’s straining to poo. He used to fall asleep straight after a feed and now he’s wide awake and fussing and gets very upset if you try to lay him down.

I’m wondering if there’s any ‘magic fixes’ anyone knows to help him reduce trapped wind? 

So far we’ve tried:
*Burping during and after feeds (doesn’t always work)
*Infacol
*Keeping him upright after a feed for a while.
*Rubbing his tummy to encourage poo.
*Holding uptight on shoulder and running/patting back.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"My 4wk old father had suddenly started to cry during feeding.

"My SO and I (and SD too) can now breathe easy.  A couple of months ago I posted about a situation that we had here:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/cm41jv/just\_when\_everything\_was\_going\_great/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/cm41jv/just_when_everything_was_going_great/) 

For a TLDR on our overall situation:  My SD 15 came to live with us about a year ago full time when BM passed away from ovarian cancer.  BM was raised by her father and step mother.  BM's father had given her $$ towards a downpayment of her house in cali in 2007. BM's step mom and half sister came out of nowhere in August and had us (my SO and I) served papers that they wanted 2/3 of the money that is in my SD's trust to go to them and wanted visitation of SD.

In September the attorney for BM's step mom called our attorney and was very forceful that they wanted us to settle out of court and they would settle for essentially what would come out to about 20% of what's in SD's trust.  My attorney was adamant that we shouldn't even consider settling since these folks had no involvement in BM's life or SD's life for that matter.  They were invited to many events for SD and when we organized services for BM they didn't show up.  The last time my SD saw them was when she was a toddler at some sort of family thing in CT that my SO has pictures of. 

Anyway we told them no multiple times, we were going to court.  Prior to going to court child protective services came to our house multiple times to interview us.  That was pretty awful.  The case worker assigned to us was assuming we were bad parents and were hiding money.  Even though we have all of the financial records in order and pretty much everything that BM minus a small % we used for down payment on the house we live in (which BM told us to do that she would not take no for an answer and put it in her will) is in a trust for SD.  They showed up at SD's school and pulled her out of class and were asking her all sorts of questions around abuse which is not what this case is about at all.  They also asked if she was happy that her mother was dead. What a horrible thing to ask someone who lost her mother.  She got very upset and SO left work to go get her.   My opinion of child protective services is now pretty low.  My SO and I complained and were told these were standard questions.  

If that wasn't bad enough case worker from CPS became obsessed with the fact that I'm 40 and pregnant. She kept asking why I waited this long and made all these terrible comments.  

We had our initial appearance in family court last week.  It was more of a moderation session. I've never been to family court so maybe this is how this always goes, but I expected more law &amp; order, but it was like everyone in a room that looked like a conference room.  The judge listened to each side and then he called upon SD and she answered a bunch of questions including if she wanted visitation with her step grandma and she said no.

The judge complimented us and how we have made a good home for SD after her mother's passing.  Since there was no evidence either way that her Dad lent her money or if she paid it back the judge ruled that it get thrown out. 

Because there was a family court case we are required to have two more visits with CPS.

"My daughter is very good at going on the potty when we put her there ourselves. She will pee and poo on the potty at home or in a public toilet without hassle as long as we take her. The problem is that she has poor communication skills, generally speaking. Her pediatrician insists that she is not delayed because she has a good vocabulary, but she doesn't answer direct questions or respond to conversation, ever. For example, ""What is your name?"", ""Do you want a snack?"" or ""How old are you?"" will be met with a blank stare, but she will spontaneously tell us her name, age, and whether she wants something to eat or drink in a full sentence. She will not even respond to simple sentences like ""It's time for bed,"" or ""Let's go to the park."" However, she will say ""We go to the park now,"" or ""I'm sleepy, bed time!"" She understands the concepts and can speak well, but doesn't seem to want to communicate **with** us, she wants to communicate **at** us.

"My ex and I were together for 10 years, married for 8. We have one child together from the relationship: a 6 year old girl. Last October, I discovered that he has been cheating on me for at least the past year. I filed for divorce (finalized last week!) and will be moving across the country to my home state next week. We have split custody, where I will get our daughter for the school year in my home state and he will get our daughter for summer and spring breaks, as well as every other winter break in his home state. When I leave next week, our daughter will be staying behind with my ex until I pick her up at the end of summer.



My concern is this: his affair partner. I've been around her a handful of times, and each time I have been polite and respectful to the both of them, where she has come back with vitriol every time. I am worried about leaving my daughter in the hands of a woman who seemingly hates me, so I have asked my ex if she would be willing to meet up (all three of us) in a public place (restaurant) to discuss parenting plans for my daughter. She agreed, and we meet tomorrow morning to talk over breakfast. Unfortunately, now that it's actually going to happen, my mind is at a complete loss as to what to say/ask/discuss. I feel I need to do this for my daughter's sake, but I am also not looking forward to it at all.



My question is: what should I ask/do/say? and Has anyone else been able to sit down with their ex's affair partner to discuss parenting, and if so, how did it go?



Here's some (hopefully pertinent) information:


*Due to the law of the state we got divorced in, we have had to live together during the entire divorce procedure. He has slowly been moving his affair partner in while I still live here.


*We waited to explain the divorce/move to our daughter until we were absolutely positive what would be happening with custody (he did not want me to move to home state and agreed it was best at the last moment) so she just found out a few weeks ago. She has had little time to process the divorce/move. I'm worried that he will thrust his affair partner on our daughter right after I leave, which could be traumatic for her.


*He has been bringing his affair partner around our daughter since October, so our daughter knows of her.


*He has been cheating on his affair partner since they started seeing each other, and I am worried that she might go ""bunny-boiler"" when she finds out.


Please help! Thank you!

"My first babe was frank breech, I went into labor naturally...progressed to 6cm in a few hours and everything was pretty good but those damn baby bums are not as effective on a cervix as a head so we ended up with a CS and by all measures it was great.

The current plan is to labor at home under her care for as long as possible and transfer if/when needed. She would remain with me and continue with my care in the hospital.

"My girlfriend of 18 months has a 4 year-old son from before we were a couple. We don't live together and mostly see each other on weekends. She and him live with her mom and younger sister. Other than when he goes to see his dad for summers and certainly holidays, I'm the main adult male presence in his life.

Me and her have a great relationship, but for me, the son throws a wrench into things. We can't have much adult fun without significant advance planning because we have to find a sitter, so we either go do stuff that we can all do (which has its limits) or just hang around the house (both of which get old fast). 

My relationship with the son is complicated. He's not a bad kid, but he's not the angel my girlfriend and his family make him out to be. He's stubborn, often belligerent, doesn't follow directions, super picky eater, never wants to do anything but watch TV, refuses to eat meals but then wakes up in the middle of the night claiming he's hungry, throws tantrums in which he not only makes a scene but refuses to speak about why he's upset which makes the situation even more difficult to navigate, and most upsetting for me: he's a quitter. We'll try to teach him something or introduce him to something and he'll either outright refuse to attempt it or quit on it almost immediately, even when it's something he's capable of doing. Perhaps these are traits all 4 year-olds have, but they seem particularly egregious with him. 

On the other hand, he's whip smart, pretty clever, friendly to most, full of energy and has a good, kind heart. And these are the traits people always bring up when they talk about him. It seems like I'm the only one who sees when he's misbehaved, which is not infrequently (again, probably common for a small child, but still). Arguing with a chorus of his cheerleaders makes me feel insane or that I'm wrong for not loving him.

I struggle dealing with the kid. It know it's not necessarily my place to discipline him, but at times, I don't feel like his mom, aunt, and grandmother are doing a good enough job of curbing his behavior. There's a lot of picking him up and putting him on their laps and telling him ""hey, don't do that"", but never any real consequences when he does it again immediately. And I don't want to see the kid punished, but I think he needs it sometimes.

I wanna love the kid and grow to treat him like my own son one day, but it's a difficult road. Sometimes when I'm around him, I find myself filling up with anger, even if he hasn't done anything wrong. We get along sometimes, but other times I push him away when he's trying to bond with me because of his behavior I disapproved of from earlier that day or week. Ifeel like maybe I don't actually dislike him personally, but just resent him for 1. being an obstacle to an easier relationship with my girlfriend and 2. being the result of parenting/disciplining I don't always agree with.

Anyway, I guess my problem is that I know I'm the asshole in the situation (or at least I feel like it) and I want advice on what I should do. How can I develop a better relationship with my girlfriend's son who don't like half the time? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend's son from a previous relationship is a tough cookie but everyone doesn't seem him as I do. Even with his behavior, though, I feel like I don't treat him as lovingly as I should. I feel bad for not having a better relationship with him and I don't want to be an asshole to a good kid for the rest of my life.

"My girls are 14 months - 12mo adjusted.

She eats, just not as much.  They are on the smaller size bc of their low birth weights (17.5 and 18lbs), so I'm still nervous about making sure they are getting enough to eat and staying hydrated throughout the day.

So my question - do I just stop worrying about the one who is refusing a bottle, but eats a good amount, and continue to offer straw cups with milk/water throughout the day?

"My husband and I are both atheists.  I was raised in a Christian church with a Pentecostal mother and an Atheist father. I went to church regularly and was a believer until my early 20's. My father never had a problem with us going to church because we were so young and he figured it wold work out when we got older.  He was right and as an adult, I am not a believer, but I am very respectful of the beliefs of others.  I very much dislike how polarizing religion is and really wish everyone could just keep their beliefs to themselves and get along as members of the same planet.  I know this is a bit naive, and I accept that.  Anyway, my husband is 100% different.  He views any non-atheist as an enemy spreading lies to further their agenda. When we were dating I found this to be annoying, but figured we'd work through it.  

Fast forward 11 years, we have two young girls (5 &amp; 3) and religion is really just not a topic in our home.  This is difficult because outside of my father and brother, my entire family is Christian. So my kids get tastes of Christianity here and there. But it's getting to the point where we can't just change the topic as a distraction.  We need to have a real conversation with our 5 year old.  

If I were a single parent, I would encourage her to learn about many different religions.  I would tell her that no matter what someone believes, it is near and dear to their heart and she must respect that.  Everyone is free to believe what feels right to them and she is, too.  I would tell her that as she grows up she will learn a lot about the world and one day it will become clear what is right for her life, but for now to explore and ask questions and learn as much about everything as she can. 

If my husband was a single parent, he would teach her that anyone who believes in God is spreading lies or is an idiot. That religion has led to some of the worst wars in the world and endless pain and suffering due to mis-guided ideas and interpretations.  That people use it to feel righteous.  Non-atheists are our enemy and deserve zero respect. 

So, this is really hard because we are equally her parent and equally have the right to share our beliefs, but I feel that his message of hate is unacceptable. He is respectful enough of me to have never shared these thoughts with our girls, but the time is nearing when we have talk with her about what Mommy and Daddy believe.  She knows that we don't believe in God, but we sort of just left it at that. She also knows that all the relatives that she loves and respects do believe in God. The situation has been exacerbated recently when she started school and became best friends with a Christian girl whose father is a minister. She hears many things at her friend's house and comes home with questions.  It's time to talk with her.

"My husband and I are both from religious upbringings. Him more so than me. I went to Catholic school, but outside of school, I rarely went to Church and my dad was fairly open about not being religious. My husband's family is fairly religious, but not obsessively so. Hubs and I are atheists.

We're still planning on celebrating these holidays and all the fun traditions with our kids. We also plan on explaining the history and origins of the traditions. Christmas and such is part of American culture, and we find no point in shielding them from the story of baby Jesus and all that. It's relevant in the society we live in. Even if one does not believe in religion, understanding religious context is important to understanding a culture. We'll present it as a story, just like any other. And otherwise just enjoy Christmas as a fun Winter celebration. Or Easter in Spring.

"My little guy sucks as much as he can, but there is just not enough there. I am cleared out after each meal, I can feel it, and if I do pump afterwards, I am lucky to get a few milliliters.

"My son is 8.5 months old. We've coslept and breastfed on demand from the beginning. All of this is great. However, a few things are tripping me up.

"My son is a very new four years old. Lately, his dad and I have both expressed frustration with my kid's newfound love of sass. He will tell adults to be quiet, or that they're not his boss. I'm saying this to explain that we are both aware, and working with our kid on understanding that that isn't okay. 

To clarify, I'm not talking about full out tantrums. He's never screamed at me or attempted to hit me. His behavior isn't out of control, or destructive. Basically, it's mildly annoying. 

I went to pick up my kid at the babysitter yesterday. Pretty much every day she tells me he's had a bad day. He threw something. He wouldn't eat lunch. He wouldn't nap. I walk away feeling discouraged every time. How is he *that* bad every day? I live with this kid. I'm not walking around stressed and upset with him. Maybe he's different there? 

Yesterday though. I walked in, and the first words out of her mouth were, ""We had a mouthy little brat today"". At first I thought she meant someone else brought their kid. I seriously couldn't believe she was referring to MY kid as a brat right in front of me. She continued by explaining that my kid told her fiance that he ""wasn't the boss of him"".

I'm thinking about firing her. It's totally cool with me that she's frustrated. My kid isn't her own. His sassiness may feel out of control with her. However, I've worked at a preschool. I've been hit, scratched, bit, screamed at. I still didn't tell the parent that their kid was a brat. It left me feeling like she just doesn't like my kid and that maybe that isn't a healthy environment for him to be in. I don't think she would ever hurt him, but if she's calling him a brat to me, what is she saying to him?

I dunno. Am I just being overly sensitive?

Next week I will marry the love of my life and become the step parent to her two wonderful teenage daughters. My fiancee was born in South America and comes from a very strong family background. Her attitude is generally to keep her girls under her wings as long as humanly possible whereas I more inclined to prepare them for the struggles of adulthood. My future wife is in her early forties and I am in my early thirties. So far this has been a blessing as I usually can see where both sides are coming from when disagreements and squabbles occur. Both girls are extremely sweet to me and feel extremely lucky to be a part of their lives. I was raised extremely conservatively in what America would consider poverty. Whereas they are all upper middle class as I am now. How do I balance teaching them the importance of saving planning and working for what they want.

"Not a parent but a child here, 

&amp;#x200B;

since I'm a child of a single mom I want to give some information about some things from the perspective of a child/teenager. So since my dad died 8 years ago my so mom had to raise me (almost 18) and my two year older brother alone. It's pretty hard to raise kids on your own obviously but a lot of people don't seem to realise that single parents not only have to do all the parenting things on their own, but there also have a monopoly on authority. As a single parent you can make all the rules you want and there's no other person to challenge these rules since the kids can't do much about them. Also as a child who are gonna talk to when you have a problem about your mom/dad? You can't talk to the other parent obviously. This is pretty annoying and frustrating. I'm not sure where I'm going with this post, just if you're a single mom don't go to hard on your kids we know you have to go threw a lot but the children also have to struggle with a lot",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,"No parent, only a child, because I am a child of a single mother and would like to say something about certain issues from a child's / adolescent's point of view.

"Not sure if this is the best place to post this, so point me in another direction if not. I recently had my son assessed for ADHD. I suspected he had the inattentive type, though he does seem hyperactive at times. He is struggling with a couple of things in school so I mostly wanted to see if this was an issue, so we could have some resources available for him so he can succeed. But after completing and having his teacher complete the questionnaire we were given, he didn’t score high enough for a diagnosis. What the doctor did notice is that the co-morbidity section of the assessment pointed to anxiety. This is not news to me, he has suffered anxiety since he was very young (DH has it also) and it has always been a concern of mine, though I wanted to wait to see if it got better as he got older. It has, though it is still an issue. The doctor who analyzed his ADHD assessment said that a lot of symptoms that look like ADHD can actually be related to anxiety. She also said that the very things he is struggling with in school (reading comprehension, inference, inability to re-tell a story/passage) are also things that children with anxiety struggle with. Honestly he explanation wasn’t convincing, but her next steps for us were to either see a psychiatrist or a developmental pediatrician. I’m going the route of development pediatrician at this point, psychiatrist doesn’t feel right.

Anyway, what I am here for is to find out if any of you parents have been in a similar situation. Were doctors able to help your kid? What can I expect from a developmental pediatrician evaluation? My son is also pretty shy so I am hoping he’s able to open up. I still think there may be an ADHD component to whatever he is dealing with.

"Now I don't have it as hard as other kids my age, and I certainly don't get abused, but here basically my life story so far(also this is on mobile). My dad had a really cool job as an IT person and wouldn't be at home until late 6 pm, but only on the weekdays. My dad stayed home on the weekends and basically went full anti-vaxer mode on me(I am vaxed btw, he just acts as if I am not). From the day I was born to when I was about 9, he usually came home, said hi to us, went straight upstairs and vanished until my mom started watching her tv shows at around 8pm. In that time I would usually get some device like my phone or my mom's tablet and waste time untill I had to go to sleep. During the weekdays my entire day was fine, until it came to the weekends. As soon at it is 8 30 in the morning, my dad basically shoves me off my bed and tells me to go use the shower. On the weekends my dad has 4 phases. 
1: The weird( almost a perv) phase
2: the calm, ordinary parent phase
3: Full on anime fight phase
4: The lecturer

Phase 1: My dad gets really close to me at times and is creepy at some points. Although I'm a boy, he almost treats me as if he was a low level pedophile! Some days, he'd even take a shower with me or use the same bathroom as me even when I am occupying the space, and now that I'm looking back at it, I'm disgusted at him, but more disgusted about how I never told anybody else. Right now, as I'm writing this post my dad is making smooching noises and it's bothering me, a lot.

Phase 2: This phase is what everybody would expect from a parent, a nice, sane parent. From an occasional I love you to him asking how I am, he's nice and gentle. But soon it all changes when  I do one simple thing wrong. Apparently not pushing a chair 2 inches further on the table results in him going to phase 3, and trust me it's always a bs reason. Most of the time it isn't my fault at all, sometimes even his!

Phase 3: Shit's about to go down. I normally don't curse but just thinking about my dad acting like this is just, ugh. Before I said that I wasn't abused, and that's true, but the amount or times he's hit me as a child makes me wonder if I should've called CPS(child protective services). I remember him hitting me with anything he sees in sight, even hitting me with my sisters phone, my wet towel, and even A FUCKING HAMMER. I remember crying so hard my face was eroded by water. I can't even express how much pain he's caused on to me, and I even tried to kill myself once. Along with this sadness that he causes, I also have my array of 'sicknesses' as he calls them. Ever since I was born my skin around my arms and face have always been terrible, and over time I'm embarrassed to wear shorts, short sleeves, or any other clothing that expresses my skin to school or in the public. My dad buys these foreign essential oil packs and pills hoping it will help me but none have availed so far(this is what I meant by full anti-vax mode earlier)

Phase 4: Full on lecture. If me or my siblings do one thing wrong, there is going to be a big meeting for at least 1 or 2 hours long. In this session he would basically blame me for doing something wrong and vent all of his anger on me going off topic( for example pushing in chairs went from that to a full on closing the door securely but not too loud. Like how in TF did he get there?). I remember my sibling wanted to join marching band( and my other sister was already in it) but he had the same conversation that he had with my sister and it didn't even help in any way! Also, my sibling got hurt from marching band(very minor) and my dad almost took her out of it, and that was a day before the final competition. 

Needless to say, I've always had mixed feelings for my dad. Overtime I've learned to find a way to basically divert myself from his field of destruction and he rarely ever hurts me as much as he did before. If any of you are still reading this long post(which nobody would since im basically worthless), and you can relate, just hang in there. It gets better as time goes on. Suicide is never the way to escape, and there are many other places to get help and the life you deserve. This is my first post but most likely my most important one, so if anybody has any tips that can help me please do so!

"Okay so I am totally new to BC. Although I am opting for an IUD, my gynecologist had a nuvaring laying around and let me try that out to see if I liked it.

"Omg. I am about to go insane. We've been working on potty training with my 28 m/o boy now for a week and a half. It was going pretty good. 95% of pee was going in the potty and he even got 2 poops in the potty.

"Pardon my format, I am on my cell phone. This is my 5yo daughters first year of grade school, and since the begining she has struggled in kindergarten.

I have been reading more into gifted children and it describes her perfectly, the hyperactivness and constantly questioning authority etc. As well as kids being misdiagnosed as ADHD.

"Posting this in regards to the  2F I nanny for on the mother’s behalf as she is not super familiar with reddit. 

LO is 26 mo and has two older siblings (5F and 7M) and is demonstrating little desire to begin talking. In all other areas, she is developmentally on track... it’s just this talking that she’s stubborn about. I know that she can hear and understand what I’m saying because I will ask her to put her shoes on, put something away, eat, locate a body part, or point to an animal in a book and she listens. However, she has little interest in talking.

So far the only words she uses regularly are: ma ma, da da, baby, go, me, hot, ok, yay, pretty, and na na (what she calls me). She didn’t start to use these until about two months ago. 

She will also make an oink sound, a horse neigh, and a roof for a dog that she loves to do all day long. 

I think the problem is that she has no NEED to verbalize because we can understand what she wants through her non verbal communication (I.e she will pat the floor if she wants me to sit, Pat an object if she wants me to open it, point to food if she wants to eat, shake her head no if she doesn’t want something). Her siblings do not talk for her, but again, we all know what she wants through her non verbal cues. I have watched countless early intervention speech therapy videos and have done the tips and suggestions such as sounding out the syllables, verbalizing and enunciating the syllables when she points “oh you want an AP-PLE, say AP-PLE”  I noticed when I ask her to say something, she will make a whining sound and shake her head all pouty. If she does say a word it is usually unprompted. 

Everything else she just refers to as “BA BA” or “GAH GA.” Mom and I are starting to worry and get frustrated... what can we do? Any tips/advice??? Ps. Mom does NOT want to get her evaluated for speech therapy until she is three ... she is adamant about this despite my suggestion to do so, so I am looking for some strategies to implement when I am with LO during the week.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Her choice between the microhair dryer tubes and The Bachelor (...) is premature.

"Quick backstory my (25M) girlfriend (22F) had a solid life for our age (we were 23,21 respectively when we found out we were expecting) I had just finished college and just got a good paying job, she was working full time. We had just moved into a luxury apartment and adopted a puppy. We did whatever we wanted, had no time to think about having a baby or anything (in fact I don’t even think we once discussed it, even in jest) we were living comfortably and I don’t think either of us wanted to have a baby. Fast forward about 6 months after we moved in. We had just come back from a vacation with some friends and she told me she was pregnant. She was visibly distraught and was like that for quite a few days. Neither of us knew what to do, we didn’t want this baby, it was going to ruin our way of life. 

Well luckily our families supported us through this time, and helped make sure we were on track with everything we needed to prepare. I was out of town for business when she had learned we would be having a boy (to which I was excited) and the next few months moved by quick. She worked doubles every single day up until like 2 days before she was due, I still have no clue how she did it. We saved every bit of money that we could.

Then he was born (1 year, 1 month ago) and y’all.. I have no idea why I didn’t want this baby at first. Ever since the first second I laid eyes on him he’s been my world. Before I wake up and go to work I want to check on him (although I don’t because I don’t wanna wake him up for my girlfriend to deal with that early lol) and I get so excited to come home and play and spend time with him. Used to be I couldn’t wait for the weekend so I could go out with my buddies, now I can’t wait for the weekend because that’s 2 full days I get to spend with my son, who I guess is my best friend now lol. I’d do anything for the little guy.

I know 24 isn’t that young compared to some other people who’ve had children young. But man I’m just so excited to be able to still be young when he grows up so that I can do everything with him. Hell I’ll barely be 41 by the time he graduates high school. I can’t wait to be able to help him with sports, fix cars, anything he wants to do.

I know this probably has been a ramble but I just needed to express it to someone lol. Thanks for listening!",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"I decided to consult him.

"Quick summary.  I'm 37, this is my second pregnancy, di/di twins, naturally conceived.  My first pregnancy was a singleton, my son was born 11 months ago.

With my first son, due to my age, we had cell free DNA testing done, to screen for genetic abnormalities.  I've also had all the standard (and some non standard) testing done to see if I'm a carrier for anything horrible (I'm not).  We were planning on doing the same testing for this pregnancy, knowing that with twins, it's an imperfect science.  I just got off the phone with my perinatologist and he said that the American Society of OBs (I believe?) just released a statement saying that they did not suggest that cell free DNA testing be used in multiples, due to a lack of studies on the effectiveness and accuracy of said tests.  The perinatologist offered the possibility of quad screening, as that's been around much longer, but did note that it's got a 5-10% false positive rate, and given my age, it's probably going to be closer to the 10% side.

We're scheduled for the NT scan next week, at about 11+4.  To be honest, I was depending on the blood test to settle my nerves about something being wrong, but the doctor, who I respect a great deal, doesn't think it's a good idea.  Does anyone else have experience with any of these tests in a multiples pregnancy?  At an 'advanced maternal age'?  What happened?  Was it useful, was it a good idea?  I don't want to do invasive testing without a REALLY good reason, the risk of miscarriage, no matter how small, is scary, but I also don't want to have to carry a fetus that's incompatible with life because it's too dangerous to do a selective reduction by the time we find out.  I realize the risk of something being wrong is quite small, but I'm a worrier.  The blood test really put me at ease with #1, I was kind of leaning on that this time too.  :/",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"I am 37, this is my second pregnancy, di / di twins, conceived naturally.

"Really needing some perspectives because (I'll just go ahead and blame them) these pregnancy hormones are making me a little sensitive, especially to pretty much anything my mother-in-law does. We have a great relationship, but shes known for being a little over-the-top. 

Just to give some context, my husband and I are having our first baby in March. We are so excited and so are our families. My husband is a grad student and we dont have a ton of money right now but are doing okay and willing to do whatever to make things work for this baby. I think my mother in law thinks we are one bill short of eviction and keeps trying to buy us really expensive gifts for the baby (my husband's family is pretty wealthy). It feels like she is somehow trying to compensate for the fact that we can afford some of this stuff ourselves. Specifically, she told us she would like to buy is a rocking chair, which is great. One less thing I have to buy myself. But the one she is wanting to get us is 400 dollars. I feel this is excessive no matter how much money you have, and I dont know if I'm comfortable accepting this gift. 

Anytime she buys us something, she tells me how much it was, and that makes me really uncomfortable. Is she complaining that she spent so much? Does she want me to feel guilty? Does she want me to fall at her feet in gratitude? I just dont understand. I also feel like, if you're going to spend 400 dollars on us, pay a hospital bill or help pay for something more important than a rocking chair! Thoughts?

She never used to be like this but for awhile now bedtime is always a fight that takes an hour or two after lights out.

At night she’s tired and yawning, but will fight it with every fiber of her being.

My 17 y/o is not college bound - she has had a lot of trauma which has contributed to her not being on track to graduate with a regular HS diploma. She has been at a school for kids with high needs for 5 years. She has much anxiety around school and her current reading and math skills are maybe 4th grade level. She’s smart and kind and eager to learn, but she has a different starting point and pace and needs help feeling safe. Among other things, no regular HS diploma means she will not qualify for financial aid, even to take a class at the community college. 

One of the most positive things in her life is her job in food services - she is learning and contributing there and I’m proud of her. After HS, she can work and continue to learn skills to enable her to be independent at some point in the future. It won’t be when she is 18, but she does not understand this. She wants to be independent right now.

She wants very much to go to college, she has been talking about it as long as I’ve known her. I get it, college has been touted as a pilar if success, freedom, and independence. I think she is coming to understand that college is not something in her plans right now, but she is sensitive about it. It is one more thing that sets her apart from the other girls.

I don’t know whether I should take her to this GS meeting today (I could take her to do something fun instead), or how to prep her or talk to her about this.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Well, I'm not a mom, I help parents and I care about my 17-year-old neighbour, she was busy, she's emotionally handicapped, and one of the things I do with her is take her to Girl Scouts and all Girl Scout events.

"So I feel like a dope. Last week, my wife sent me to the store to pick up diapers and wipes. Easy peasy. Today, we took our 4 month old daughter to the doc because of a yeast infection.

"So I have been planning for a VBAC my whole pregnancy. I was feeling good about trying and avoiding the risks of C-section. I am 2 weeks away from my induction and growing more upset about it though.

I had my first daughter vaginally, however induction was not neccessary. My son was a C-section due to him being breech. This pregnancy has been high risk for numerous reasons. I am having a lot of anxiety about the possibility of uterine rupture and also about my induction which I found out would be by foley bulb. Prior to my first daughter being born, I had a traumatic and painful abortion. I am so sensitive to pelvic exams and anything to do with my cervix. I have an emotional/physical reaction to even thinking about anything to do with my cervix. I have been trying to work this out with my therapist but it hasn't been going well.

I can't kick the feeling that labor and delivery is going to be terrible for me. I don't expect a VBAC to be painless at all but I feel like I will be in physical and mental anguish even before there is a chance for any other complications. Listening to the midwife explain the foley bulb was hard for me and I have been having flashbacks of the cervical pain I have experienced in the past. She said they would be giving me cervical checks as well.

I really just needed to vent this out. Has anyone changed their mind on their birth plan right at the end?

So I have been separated for about 3 years and have had dates here and there. I have a dating profile also. Lately I’ve been getting messages or even after 1 or 2 dates of guys saying “ no one would wanna be with you or take you serious because you have 3 kids” (I say I have 3 kids before even meeting anyone) and it’s been making my self esteem go really low. My kids are my life and it just hurts when people say that. They’ve said maybe if you only had one kid we can build.

"So I’m 12 weeks postpartum and on Jan 23 I started to lightly bleed. Is that normal? I stopped bleeding about 2-4 weeks postpartum. So I’m kinda worried about bleeding again but since I’m not soaking up a heavy pad within an hour or two I’m also not worried.

"So here lately I've been down, wondering if I'm cut out for this whole ""caring for a child that's not your own"" bit, due to some building resentment and jealousy I had been neglecting.
Well, today my boyfriend and I took his daughter to the park and she wanted to play ""family.""
She said ""I'll be the kid. Daddy you're the dad. And Sydney you're the mom.""
I thought this was sweet but I didn't make a deal of it I just said okay and started acting motherly to her, calling her baby and stuff.
Throughout the duration of our time at the park, she continued to call me mom and momma.
Now, I would never encourage her to call me that, but if she's comfortable with it, I'm totally okay with it.
The point is, even amidst the feelings I was having toward whether ""step mom-ing"" was something I essentially wanted or not, it definitely affirmed to me that I'm doing something right in this little girls life for her to look at me as a motherly figure and feel comfortable enough to call me as such. Even if it was ""just a game"" in the beginning.
Her BM and FSD are great people and she has even mentioned that when they get married she wants to call him dad.
I know some bio parents have issues with their kids calling the step parents ""mom"" or ""dad"" but I think it makes it easier for the child to feel like they're in a balanced, loving home.
Just wanted to share this! Hope it can inspire some SM's or SD's to stick through the hard stuff and realize the little things your SK's do to show you they care.

"So my baby is almost 10 weeks old, and I went back to work last week.  We've been giving her only breastmilk (have introduced a bottle, she's a champ), I'm pumping at work and we have been getting enough, supply isn't a problem.

I'd like to have my husband give a formula bottle at the 'bedtime' feeding.  I want it to be formula b/c I just don't want to pump at home, I hate pumping and I just can't do more then I'm doing.

"So my four month old son has never been a great napper. Mostly 20-30 minutes at a time on his back. A friend of ours gave us a Greco rocking swing and we discovered he sleeps well in it if he is wrapped up and moving. Anywhere from 45-90 minutes in the swing.

It has been hitting me really hard that I will not be able to give my parents grandchildren and to be honest that realization is crushing me.  They would be such amazing grandparents. AND please understand, they have in no way brought this up, or pressured me or anything like that.  I just feel like some of the weird paths that life has taken me has led me to fail them.

"So, just as the title says, my father was adopted.  His adoptive parents were wonderful, amazing people who raised him to be a great man and father, but I have always wondered about his birth family.  He always said he would not search for them until his adoptive parents passed away, because he never wanted to hurt them.  My grandma passed away in 2004 and my grandpa 10 years earlier.  He still never actively searched until recently.  I never wanted to ask anything about it, because it was his business and not mine and he was always pretty sensitive about it.  One day though, this past winter, he asked me to help him find his birth family, which I was quite shocked with.  He’s not the most computer savvy person, and he was hoping I could help him by searching social media and what not.  He gave me all the information that he had (birth certificate and the names of his bio parents).  It took about a half an hour but I had found both them.  His birth father had passed away but his birth mother is still alive and also has facebook (which is also shocking because my dad is 65).  I gave him what I found and he mailed a letter to her.  It ended up being returned.  My father took that as he either has the wrong address or she saw the return name and address and sent it back.  He has since given up.  My question is, would it be appropriate for me to send her a Facebook message?  Neither of us want anything from her, we really just want to know her.  I also know that my dad would be thrilled if he could have some contact with her.  I also don’t want to message her kids or grand kids, because there is a good possibility that they may not even know that my dad exists.

"So, the last couple weeks, my son has been acting... off. I just started a new full time job, I had to switch daycares, and now I'm facing a brand new living situation, and I'm having a little trouble. My son is having issues adjusting to everything new, but it seems to only happen when he's with me. When I'm not around, my babysitter says behavior wise he is great. There are no issues with his appetite, his demeanor or anything. 

But as soon as I pick him up from daycare, and get him in the car, the whining starts. He whines, he cries, and his favorite word for everything right now is ""no, it's not."" We went from living with just he and I to living with 4 other people, so I know it's a HUGE change and he doesn't know how to deal with it. He doesn't get as much one on one mommy time as he used to when we lived alone and I only worked part time.

What I'm wondering is how do I help him adjust? What things can I do to ease the transition into all these big changes? It's beginning to be very frustrating for me because it seems like nothing I do helps. I am trying to make sure I always pay attention to him when he's talking to me, but when it comes to normal, every day things like bathing, going potty, even eating, he HAS to have me there or sitting on my lap for him to even be calm. 

I don't want him to feel like his world is upside down, and I want to help him feel better. Others that have been in this situation, how did you deal with it? What can I do to make him feel more comfortable with my family?

"Some backstory. Me and my two full siblings were raised mainly by my father. He passed away a few years ago and during that time my mother remarried and has 3 children with her current husband. Including me the ages of all my siblings go 27, 25 (me), 21, 9, 8, 2. Also, my mother and her husband both work around 60 hours a week at all hours so there is no schedule in their house.


Now my mother and I have a strained relationship and only reconciled after my father's passing for the sake of my younger sister (21). I visit her and my half siblings around 4 times a year and every time I go up there I leave feeling sad for those kids. Comparatively to me and my siblings, those kids are extremely behind developmentally because no one is helping them with schoolwork, they are never allowed to leave the house or play outside, and they are not being taught any moral baseline. 


I always keep this to myself and try to help in ways that I can but I almost lost it at the most recent news I heard from my sister (21) that lives with them. The older two kids (9 &amp;8) saw a cat outside with a collar that was very friendly and decided they wanted it. So they brought it into the house and that was it. My mother decided 'looks like we have another cat hahaha'. I told her 'it has a collar and was friendly on site? That is some other family's cat. At least go to a vet or shelter and have it scanned for a microchip'

My mother's response ""Not this again! If you take that cat from them you're going to break their hearts!"" And then she walked into her room and went to sleep. This is incredibly wrong in my eyes and should have been a perfect opportunity to teach the kids ""look someone lost their family member! Let's help find them and be good people!"" My sister (21) has tried to find the owner's but the same thing happened with her in that my mother wouldn't let her.

The only excuse I can find for my mother and her husband letting their kids do things like this is that they are so tired from work that they have essentially 'given up' on parenting. To you parents out there, is this what that is?

UPDATE: I posted a found kitten ad on craigslist myself and I believe I have found the owner within an hour of the posting. They have proof and all the correct information about the kitten. When I told my mother she said ""Well why in the hell would you go and look for them? FINE! You get to tell the kids why you're breaking their hearts then!""",True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Me and my two full siblings was primarily attracted by my father.

"There's an issue I have with a lot of the information and posts I see regarding life as a parent to a child with Downs. Most of the time it's portrayed as a very ""pink and fluffy"" life, and it's something I take issue with as a father who wants to be prepared for *real* reality, not a sugar-coated one.

I love my daughter, and she makes me absolutely happy and grateful to be her father. I have never met a human being who is so consistently happy and eager to learn and play.

With the exception of walking, and some talking, she has hit every one of her milestones early. She's cruising now, so walking should be very close. She's talking, sort of, mostly two syllable words, but she likes to stick to ""da-da"" or ""dog-dog"", sometimes ""ma-ma"" but it's rare, but I've seen that as normal for language acquisition as the ""D"" sound is easier to produce at first. My wife and I work with her constantly (the way we see it, we could spend a few moments watching TV, or spend it teaching her how to walk, for example).

I want to help her become independent, have a job, maybe even drive a car if she's high functioning enough. But I want to set realistic expectations for myself. My daughter seems very ""normal."" But I have also been told by an old coworker that they tend to stay right with their peers until about 4 or 5 years old, so maybe what I'm seeing isn't indicative of how she will be down the line.

But, I want to know what I am in for later down the line. The articles I read, to put it nicely, almost never mention the hardship of having a child with a developmental delay. I consider myself very stoic, I guess you can blame the military for that. I look at life with a very objective lens, which can make me seem sort of emotionless on the surface.

I see awesome stuff, like some becoming business owners. But, the stuff I read seems very sensationalistic, and almost always the parents or caretakers are doing the majority of the difficult stuff, the person with DS is simply the face of his/her project. I could be wrong, but it seems a lot of these success stories come from very well-off families who can afford resources for their child that most people cannot.

Anyways, enough rambling. I want the harsh side of things, if anyone here can provide it. There's plenty of information on all the great stuff, but I want what's realistic.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"There's a problem with a lot of information and posts, for many I have in relation to life as a parent to a kid with Down.

"This has probably been posted a million times so I apologise but I could really use some advice.

My (28f) boyfriend (34m) of almost four years and I had a serious conversation tonight about children, and I have always been adamant about not wanting kids and he wants at least one. The more we talked about it the more I realized that if I ever was going to have kids, I would want it to be with him.

Is this just me being afraid to lose him? Is it possible to go from never wanting kids to telling him we need to have at least two because being an only child sucks within ten minutes? I did also make him acknowledge that there's a lot of steps to take with our lives before I would be comfortable starting to seriously try for kids because there definitely are.

I helped raise my oldest niece for the first year of her life, so I've done the infant thing. I know how hard it can be, how frustrating and exhausting it can be, and I think that's part of what has turned me off to having one of my own. As far as I'm aware he's never had to deal with small children except his own nieces and nephews at family gatherings, and I don't know if he's conceptualized how much babies change everything. He's an avid gamer and kind of a heavy drinker, so those are both things that I'm not sure he understands won't last long into fatherhood.

At the same time, I know I would make a kick-ass mom and having a little one or two would make both of our families so happy. His family has really been pressuring both of us, and I know my parents would love to have a grandkid that didn't live 9 hours away.

"This is more of a rant post, but we started potty training today. I’m trying to stay positive and upbeat though if I’m being honest, I’ve been dreading this day for weeks now.

She’s so quick that by the time I get to her, even standing two feet away, she’s already done peeing. And when she pees on the floor, she likes trying to splash in it like she just discovered she can literally make her own water park. Not a good sign!

"This is what we are thinking of buying for the first 3-6 months to see how CDs work for us. 


**NB stage**


1) CD service for the first month (optional up to 3 months) 

* we will possibly do this as in our area there is a service that costs the same as disposables so if the laundry is too much for me/us we can still CD

* they provide 70 prefolds/week and 2 pail liners

* cloth wipes service included ( I am not convinced I will want to use CWs when we graduate to 'real food' poops so I'll just try this out for now and see how it goes)

2) 6 covers

3) 12 prefolds for just in case situations


question: should I get doublers or liners for this stage? if yes I was thinking 6 hemp, 6 bamboo. Is that enough to take me through the next stage?


**Month 2 / infant stage** Hopefully doing laundry every other day

1)  3 pail liners and 3 wet/dry bags


2)  I've been given about 100 wipes/face cloths so I think I'll be fine for any poopocalyps 


3) still using the covers from the first month 


4) add 12 AMP NB Fitteds


5) 3 Grovia KPs


6) 3 Freetimes


7) 3 Sweet pea AIOs 


7) Depending on advice from here 6 hemp, 6 bamboo inserts/doublers


**Month 3- through to Potty Training** 

1) Still using covers/replacing as needed for sizing


2) Add 12 Sweet pea AIOs (Sized from 10lbs-35lbs)

We felt obligated to let out daughter participate. Here is my mistake, I should have asked the type of ceremony we would be participating in, my mistake and I feel VERY bad about this. The preacher got very preachy about what marriage was in his little view of the world and conduced not one prayer, but 3, throughout the ceremony. The entire time my daughter is standing next to the bride without a clue in the world what was happening. I was mortified. It was like someone drug my daughter into a strip club and left her there alone for 30 minutes.

My family has had some very negative experiences with theists over the years. We usually simply ignore everything ‘god(no particular one, just all)’ related. My family goes to such extremes to not let her play with religious families/kids, we simply feel they are a bad influence. I know my daughter will be faced with challenges growing up where she will be tempted and I want to prep her for this. How can I be a better dad?

I’m trying to play damage control after our wedding experience. Are there any parents that could assist me with bringing up the topic with her? Should I wait till she asked questions about god/gods/whatever? Or should I be proactive? How do I convey my belief system without sounding incredibly cynical, angry, and jaded? In my mind theism isn’t any more of a choice than if you would walk off a building or not.

Are there any books you could suggest about convincing my daughter theist have something to offer even if they follow things that don’t make sense?

"We just had our son 12 days ago. He tested positive for trisomy 21, and has a common av canal heart issue, both of which we fully expected.

We are trying to keep a positive attitude towards things as we are excited to get him home, only after he is ready of course.

"We're going to fly with our twins for the first time at Christmas and just bought our tickets. I think our plan is solid, but I'm hoping to get a sanity-check from the community here. The twins will be a few weeks shy of 1 year old, and our older son will be three and a half.

My big uncertainty is traveling with the large stroller: We're planning to bring our baby jogger city select with car seats and glider board through security and then gate-check it. We're flying with Delta, and per their website it looks like this should be fine. I'm planning to remove the car seat adapters and put them in my carry on before gate-checking, since they (1) look fragile compared to the stroller frame and (2) are small and easy to remove anyway. I looked into a travel bag for the stroller, but it's $80-90 which seems excessive- does anyone have one, was it worth the money? Has anyone had issues gate-checking a large (but foldable) stroller and two car seats, do we need to scrap the idea and look into a double umbrella stroller? We like this plan because it will make getting through airports much easier and means we only have to rent one car seat (convertible seat for the toddler) instead of three at our destination.

We managed to get a direct flight and it’s only about 2.5hrs, so even if it’s a hot mess it won’t be for long. My husband and I will carry the twins as lap children (5 tickets would be prohibitively expensive). The plane we'll be on has 2 seats on each side of the aisle, so there will be one adult and one baby next to our toddler and the other adult+baby just across the aisle. I picked seats in the second-to-last row, based on past travels with the toddler the back of the plane seems to be a good and socially-acceptable place for small children. Our 3yo is a pro at entertaining himself and has traveled well in the past, as long as I bring enough stuff to read and color I’m pretty sure he’ll be fine.

"We've looked into the stats and the research on this and are finding it hard to decide which delivery method we'd prefer, so are hoping some shared experiences could help us. Any advice/thoughts appreciated.

Our first birth was successful (in terms of we got a healthy baby) yet traumatic,  leaving my wife with a 3C tear and shaking our trust in the doctors and midwives. Details at the end of the post about that.

We're not planning on having another pregnancy so the main trade off seems to be between causing permanent damage and side effects to the tear, versus the risks and recovery involved in the major surgery that is c-section.

This birth will be at a different hospital (Barnet).

Our first son is will be 2 soon so will the additional recovery time mean my wife cant pick him up for longer?

And through all this we aware that no matter what we decide, unforeseen events or even just different staff on shift may mean that we end up with the other option anyway, but it seems best to have a plan.

Thanks!

Details on first birth:
Our plan was to give birth in the birth centre with as little intervention as possible but Baby was happy where he was and  so the midwives encouraged us to be induced,  with the reassurance that we could still go into the birth centre. In the end the doctors overruled that and we had to go to the ward instead. Also during all this my wife had no pain relief until she was fully dilated (thank god for hypnobirthing methods). There was also a episiotomy performed that we didnt know about until afterwards,  which may have contributed to the tear (or prevented worse tearing,  no one knows).",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"We have looked at the statistics and the research, and a decision of which delivery method we prefer is difficult for us.

"We've tried potty training 3 different times and every time we've had the same experience. We're on our 4th round in 1.5 years. We've done the naked 3 day thing. We've given him underwear so he feels the mess he makes. But all of this to say, after the first day, there are no accidents. He holds it until nap time. And then holds it until bedtime. It goes like this: 

day 1- small accidents, holding mostly, very wet diapers at nap and when he wakes up the next morning.

Day 2- holds it, but generally we will get one or two pees into the potty. When he's successful we celebrate and he gets a piece of chocolate.

Day 3- nothing at all. He will hold it. He will show signs of needing to go. He is happy to sit on the potty but will do nothing. And through all of this, especially by the end of the day he is miserable, clingy, and squirming. We get him to sit, he will not go. And it was usually by this time that we would quit because he was just so miserable and we become concerned about holding so much. Last night he peed in the bath and knew he did it and exclaimed ""I did it!"" and he became concerned with farting thinking he was going to have an accident. He also at bedtime pooped in his diaper after a few times coming out to tell us he needed the potty and we helped him and he did nothing until he was half asleep and then he came to get us. 

This time we're on day 4 and it's the same as day 3. Miserable. Holding. Squirming around.

"What do you guys do all day? Am I the weird one? So for context I am a SAHM of a 2.5yr old and a 5mo old. I find I am often tired since my lo doesn't sleep through the night yet and my toddler has strep at the moment. 

But it seems like I have a lot more control and responsibility than the other SAHM I know. I clean, cook, pay bills, balance budget, do the yard work, grocery shop, pretty much anything that is home based I do. Like I am repainting the kitchen. I told my husband I intended to do it. Showed him 3 colours I liked. We agreed on one and I did. There was no money talk because I control the budget and know the money is there. Just like I didn't ask before I signed my son up for swim. Similarly a neighbor saw me mowing the lawn and asked why my husband wasn't doing it. Simple answer it's not his job. Same neighbor saw me grilling and was equally confused again. 

Hubby helps out at home if I fall behind or get sick but I take point. The only house thing he consistently does is put the kids to bed because he doesn't see them all day.

"Within the last several months, my son has started hitting himself in the face. I would probably be less concerned if it was tantrum related, but most of the time he seems to do it just because. Part of the time being told no triggers the hitting, but often times it is for no reason at all. 
I work in Special Education, and have discussed it with my boss who has a doctorate in children’s psychology and special education. He doesn’t seem too worried about it, and believes it to be an attention seeking tactic, or an attempt to get his way after being told no. His advice was to redirect the hands, and provide positive reinforcement. 
I have been trying to worry less about it, but lately he has switched from lightly hitting himself to hitting himself super hard. And to top it off, this morning I quietly peeked into his room while he was sleeping to check on him, and he was doing it in his sleep! 
He has never been exposed to violence, and is so happy all the time. My husband and I never fight, we don’t even really bicker at each other, so I don’t understand where this is coming from.

"tl:dr - toddler declares war on sleep.
So, my 26 month old boy over the weekend decided that he didn't want to sleep anymore after he discovered he could easily crawl out of the crib. He even ended up with a bloody bottom lip at one point. So, after trying to keep in him in the crib for a night or two (failure...), my wife and I decided that last would be the best time to turn the convertible crib into a toddler bed. We did everything you were supposed to do - filled the bed with blankets and stuffed animals, read to him in the bed instead of the rocking chair like we normally and talked up the fact that he's a big boy in his big boy bed. But as soon as we walked out the door, he started wailing, jumped out of the bed (or even just running out of the bed and falling on his face) and heading straight for the door. Eventually he started crying uncontrollably. A bit of a backstory - my wife just gave my birth a month ago to an awesome little girl, but she had a really rough pregnancy so in the last several months I've done everything - put him to bed, feed him, wake him, etc. In that time he's grown really attached to me. Now that my wife is back to her wonderful self, she's doing a lot more - but he still wants me all the time. Also, he's a very stubborn and emotional kid - if he doesn't get something he wants he will scream and yell and even hurt himself. He's been known to bite down on his had really hard leave bite marks And slam his head against the door continuously when I'm in the bedroom changing or the bathroom. Back to last night - We tried keeping him in the room for a few minutes and not letting him leave, thinking that he would wear himself out and get into bed. All he did was hit his head against the door over and over again. So my wife (trying to wean him off of me) rocked him until he slept and stayed by his bed for an hour until he was asleep enough for her to leave. Before we kept him in the room we tried silently placing him in his bed every time he tried to leave his room but after about 30 minutes of that he was so emotional we just rocked him. With separation anxiety this bad, we have no idea what to do. With the newborn we are barely getting enough sleep as it is, I have a crazy commute and am almost falling asleep On the way to work, and my wife is still on maternity leave and so tired we don't know what to do. Crazy thing is, up until a week or so ago (a few weeks after the baby was born) all we had to do is kiss him and place him in the crib and he wouldn't make a peep for 12 hours. Any tips? I fully know that this might take a little while to fix, but everything I'm reading is saying stuff like ""when he gets out of his bed to play put him back in"" but he's not playing. He's panicking.

"tl:dr Korean adoption has many serious issues, how do we address them. 

Hi there, I am a transnational adoptee that has been on this sub for quite some time.  I respond to many of you through pm on my main account and have read virtually everything posted on this sub.  I guess I just wanted to just get some stuff out there I've been thinking about in regards to my adoption and some of the information I've learned about the adoption process in Korea.  I spent my whole life feeling like I was unwanted and unlovable  I was angry at my birth mother for giving up on me, and even more so I was angry at myself for not being good enough for the one person who was supposed to love me unconditionally.  I listened to my mother tell me about how much my birth mother loved me, because she carried me to full term and placed me into adoption so I would have the best upbringing possible.  But I never could accept this, how could it mean she loved me when she got rid of me? It just didn't compute.  I listened to my mother talk about the shame of being unmarried with a baby.  And I internalized it as, my existence was shameful for her, I was shameful just being alive. I've struggled my whole life trying to figure out where I fit in, never Asian enough for the handful of asians I knew, and never white enough for the people I grew up around.  I felt so isolated.  I desperately would like a reunion or some sort of information on my birth family, but the language barrier restricts much of the searching I'd be able to do were it a domestic adoption.  The information I have on my birth parents is incredibly generic, basically their ages is all I know, and leaves a lot of questions.  So I've been researching.  Researching the culture, researching the adoption process, trying to find any information I can to help bring me some answers. What I found was that the more I find out, the more I feel like I can understand what my mother was trying to tell me all these years and the more I can begin to understand the struggles and courage my birth mother had by having me. 

So to begin, a not so little history of adoption in Korea. Korean adoption began in the 50s after the Korean War.  At the time, many US soldiers impregnated Korean women and after their tour, left to return to the states.  The result was mixed race babies with no father figure left in a very patriarchal society.  North Korea at the time used these babies as fodder for pr for their cause, stating these mixed race babies were physical proof that America was trying to colonize Korea.  The S. Korean government deemed that the best solution for everyone would be to send the babies to their fatherland.  Back in America, humanitarian groups took up the effort and ads were placed in the newspaper with headlines such as ""a Korean baby for you"" - insert picture of cute Korean baby.  Korean baby adoption rates soared up until the 80s, when S. Korea began getting bad publicity for its high adoption rate.  It was looked at as a heavy baby exportation place and so limits were placed on the number of babies they were able to adopt out internationally.  Today the number is around 1000 children a year, compared to the 80s when it was about 8000 children/yr.  This adoption restriction made it so there is an increasing amount of children left to age out of the system.  There is no support for these children, in terms of social programs or societal support. At the beginning of Korean adoptions, the reason stated for placement was largely abandonment or broken families.  In today's society, a large amount of these babies put up for adoption are from a) a poor family who cannot afford to care for their child, who use orphanages as something of a day care, or b) single mothers.  I had grown up wondering why there was such a high abandonment rate of children in Korea, in a country that states that it is in a population decline and not producing enough to sustain itself.  Why abandonment was so prevalent they established baby boxes as a safe way to anonymously surrender your baby. I think the answer to this lies in understanding a little about Korean culture and lack of support for struggling families/single mothers. In Korean culture, while many look at the country as an advanced modernized society, it still remains a very traditional patriarchal society with family honor at the root of it. Even in this day and age, unwed mothers are a very taboo thing over there.  In America, divorce and single mothers are things that can be openly discussed, there is support of sorts to these women in the form of social programs and it is not that abnormal to see someone in that situation.  In Korea, being an unwed mother means the women face discrimination severe enough that she could lose her job, her home, and her family connections.  It is not unusual for people, friends, coworkers and family alike to cut off all ties with the women in fear they would be associated with the huge dishonor with having a baby out of wedlock. It is not unusual for a women to get kicked out by her landlord for having this baby out of wedlock.  It is not unusual for a company to fire a women for having/keeping this baby.  Did you know that when you apply for a job in Korea you are required to submit your family history?  And that it is not unusual in Korea to turn down a woman for a job because of the absence of the father. As far as social support for the women, if they can prove they are below the poverty line, they are eligible for about the equivalent of $70 American dollars a month from the government. Which is low even in Korea.  But did you know that when they determine if you're eligible for this, they factor in the worth of your home, your car and your possessions?  They factor in the income of your family, even though a good amount of these women were disowned by said family and that income is not a realistic part of what will contribute to the baby's rearing.  If your parents make good money, you are pretty much ineligible for the help.  Families that are struggling to raise their child are not eligible for this support at all. Did you also know that Korean families looking to adopt are eligible for ~$150 American dollars a month for adopting a Korean baby?  Regardless of income, they get double of what the government would provide for a mother who wishes to keep her child. As far as child support, it is required that the father pay child support in Korea.  But strangely enough, if the father wishes to detach and not fulfill this obligation, all he has to do is not fill out the paperwork stating he is the child's father.  He is no longer legally required to help the child in any way and the mother's paperwork alone stating he is the father is not sufficient enough to receive the support. The Ministry of Health in 2007 put out a statistic stating that out of every 100 unwed women in Korea, it is estimated that 96% of them will have abortions, 3% will surrender to adoption and only 1% will try and raise the baby.  This is a country where abortion is illegal, yet an overwhelming majority of unwed mothers opt for this because of social stigma and lack of support.  In the entire country of around 50 million people, there are only 33 programs to help unwed mothers.  But the vast majority of these are run BY adoption agencies, so oftentimes the women spends the time there being talked into why she should adopt her baby out and not how they can help her keep the baby.  It is a major conflict of interest.  These agencies get paid roughly $20,000 per internationally adopted baby while a domestic adoption will net them $4,000.   They encourage the mother to opt for international adoption so the baby will have more opportunity and not have to face the confusion of potentially seeing his/her birth mother on the subway. They tell her their children will not face discrimination if they send them away the way they would if they kept them. So what is the solution?  How can you fix the way society treats someone, a society which I am pretty detached from already.  How can we encourage a society to be more supportive of struggling families and single mothers? The adoption agencies are in the wrong to coerce a vulnerable mother into surrendering her baby while pretending to offer support, society is wrong for the way they treat these women and their children.  But saying international adoption is terrible and discouraging it only hurts the children who are already there, as seen by the international adoption restrictions already placed on the country and the rising amount of children who age out and are left to society with nothing. What is the right solution? I would love to hear some prospective from you guys. I try and support this movement by sending money to KUMFA, a Korean organization that supports single mothers, not associated with any adoption agency and founded by a woman who tried to place her baby and fought to get him back.  I try and inform adoptive parents of what my experiences were growing up as a transnational adoptee so they are better equipped to help their child deal with issues they may experience.  But it all feels like it's not big enough to make a lasting impact on the real issue.

"“Train your child in the way he should go,

This is one of the few verses that is found in the Bible relating to parenting. On some of the commentary it states that you should train them to follow the Word of God and teach them Godly precepts.

But could it mean more?

When I was a child I wanted to play the flute but my mother insisted I play the saxophone. So I played the saxophone. I didn’t enjoy it at all but I did it throughout high school. I think I would have done better if I had the opportunity to play the flute.

When my youngest son was in elementary school he had a difficulty learning how to read. I tutored him every day and made sure he did his homework before he was allowed to play. Yet he struggled with learning the alphabet because they were teaching phonics and he was more suited for whole word learning.[https://singleparentssurvivalguide.com/phonics-is-it-the-best-way-to-teach-reading/](https://singleparentssurvivalguide.com/phonics-is-it-the-best-way-to-teach-reading/)

I can remember the day when his kindergarten teacher started teaching math. She literally was exploding with joy when she told me that he was a wiz at math!

Considering I am an author and also a very successful blogger I could have shamed him for his difficulty with reading. I could have pushed him into something which he had no desire for. I chose not to be like my mother in that aspect. I chose to encourage and support him in his reading and stand in awe of him for his genius in math.

He has now graduated from engineering school and has a job offer which far surpasses anything I have ever been offered coming right out of college.

I think that the Bible may mean more than just teaching your child the Word of God. I believe it may mean to acknowledge the gifts which your children have been given from God and support them in every way possible.
