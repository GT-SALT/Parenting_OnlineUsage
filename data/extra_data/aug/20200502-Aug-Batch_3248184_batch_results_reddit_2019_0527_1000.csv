"My 8wo is incredibly sensitive to dairy, so I've gone off it just recently. Unfortunately I have about 75oz of frozen breast milk that I can't use right now because I pumped it while I was still eating dairy (he vomits and gets terrible reflux from it). So I've started pumping as much as possible for the remainder of my maternity leave (another 4.5 weeks), so I can have a stash stored for when I return to work. I'm going to continue pumping at work but I'm worried it won't be enough to provide for him while he's in childcare, since I hear your milk supply decreases significantly if you don't BF as often. We did try him on a soy based formula in case we need to supplement, but he threw that up as well and was constipated for almost 24 hours. So unfortunately it seems that dairy and soy based formulas aren't an option right now. Has anyone heard of another option for formula?

She won't be able to hold him.\n\n-She might feel kind of cornered into the visit and I know that visits can be emotionally difficult for her.

we just switched from the infant seat to a larger rear to forward facing seat. He has little to no support and his head is almost always off to one side or the other.
