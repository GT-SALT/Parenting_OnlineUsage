I was wondering if any one has had experience using the Medela comfort fit breast shields? I recently returned to work and I pump several times throughout the day. I haven't been able to pump the full amount necessary to send to daycare without stressing and putting WAY too much effort in.

Hi there. So my daughter is 13 months old and the last 3 nights she wakes up constantly. She has a bit of a cold but during the day shes not grumpy or anything and seems her normal self. She will wake up very upset sometimes and other times just cry for a second . The minute I go in there and just rub her back she falls back asleep .

"My daughter is 27 months, and we've been casually working on potty training for several months. She goes in spurts where she does okay, and spurts where she just doesn't care.

Hi! I'm trying to do some room planning for our nursery. It seems like most people on r/babybumps recommend having a glider or a rocker in the nursery but does that work as well for newborn twins?

"I'm purely curious about this. Where I live (I'm Canadian) at my birthing class/breastfeeding class we were taught that colostrum is enough in the early days until your mature milk develops (normally 3-7 days after birth), barring any medical issues or serious weight gain. My care provider amd hospital confirmed this during pregnancy.

We saw 2 lactation consultants and latch was painful until almost 8 weeks old). \n\nI'm curious because I *very often* see people post to this subreddit or other baby subreddits about how they are supplementing with formula because their milk ""isn't in yet"" or saying that they are formula feeding *until* their milk comes in.\n\nIs this just a differing in education by country?

"My 8wo is incredibly sensitive to dairy, so I've gone off it just recently.

"I ran across this a year ago.

Plus it looks like the system includes tv time for a 1-yr-old.  \n\nHowever, when I watched it I definitely saw some similarities between what worked well for us and the system.  We didn't use a train whistle, but we did blow bubbles in the bathroom anytime he went in there to sit down (regardless of if he went or not) to make it fun/distracting.  We also used sign language, and unless your kid is an early talker, I don't see how potty training before age 2 would work too well without a way to effectively have your child communicate to you.
