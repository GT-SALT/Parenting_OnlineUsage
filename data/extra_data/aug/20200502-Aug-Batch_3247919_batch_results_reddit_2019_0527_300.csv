For reference they were born at 34 and 1 and had no breathing problems.\n\nSo both my boys had/have croup. One after the other.

"Hi everyone! I am 20 weeks pregnant with twin girls and I am looking for stroller recommendations.

I can even use it when they're newborns by simply putting the seats into a laying down position, in case I don't want to use the car seats (I was told that they could spend only a minimum of 2 hrs in those). It looks like this one seems to be good for us all around. What are other recommendations?

"I EP'd from day 1 while my 25-weeker was in the NICU until about 37 weeks when we were allowed to breastfeed once per day then to 4 times a day at 43 weeks. When we finally took him home after 120 days, our discharge regimen was 4 fortified bottles a day, and so I BF'd at night. Of course, now having him home, it's not easy to pump every 3 hours and so my pumping supply eventually dropped from 100-120ml per pump to 40-60 per pump. \n\nHe is now 7 months old (3 1/2 adjusted) and 3 months home, and I am still exhausted. So to simplify my routine and save a few hours everyday on pumping and mixing formula and sterilizing bottles, we want to try exclusive breastfeeding. To ease into it, we figured I could breastfeed and supplement with bottles if he was still hungry after. Problem is, he falls asleep breastfeeding. Since my supply has lowered, I'm not sure if he's getting enough though, and I'm not sure how to tell if he sleeps because he's full or sleeps because he's not getting any milk.

Where I live (I'm Canadian) at my birthing class/breastfeeding class we were taught that colostrum is enough in the early days until your mature milk develops (normally 3-7 days after birth), barring any medical issues or serious weight gain. My care provider amd hospital confirmed this during pregnancy. When my daughter was born I breastfed from the beginning, she was never supplemented, I just fed her the colostrum (don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy though. We saw 2 lactation consultants and latch was painful until almost 8 weeks old). \n\nI'm curious because I *very often* see people post to this subreddit or other baby subreddits about how they are supplementing with formula because their milk ""isn't in yet"" or saying that they are formula feeding *until* their milk comes in.\n\nIs this just a differing in education by country? Or is it generally considered optimal to feed formula until the mature milk develops? \n\nEdit: I am absolutely not against supplementation. Only curious.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"m Canadian) in my birth / breastfeeding class, we have been taught that colostrum is sufficient in the early stages until your mature milk develops (usually 3-7 days after giving birth) apart from medical problems or serious weight gain.

You guys seems like a great source for minivan info. My twin boys are 3 months old and I'm already over my car.
