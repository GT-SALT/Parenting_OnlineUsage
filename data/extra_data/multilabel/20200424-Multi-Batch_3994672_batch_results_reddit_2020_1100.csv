74,"As parents, we are “elders” to our children and expect them to respect us as well.  This is never more important than when we are in public and our children’s behavior is being witnessed by “everyone in the world”.  How your children behave in public reflects directly on you as their parents.  Like it or not, right or wrong, other parents will pass judgment on your parenting skills based upon their observation of your children’s behavior.

Now that we are into our grandchildren years, we can look back and smile at all of those occasions in which we observed children going berserk in grocery and department stores.  You know the 3-5 year old kids I’m talking about.
Little Mary races around the grocery store display until she loses her balance and knocks the display over, soup cans careening across the isle.  The store employee shows up only to have the mother say “Sorry” as if it’s the store’s problem that the food is all over the floor, then turns to chase her child down another isle.
Little Johnny thinks its cute to see how close he can swing his light saber to the dishes on display, only to find that he has grossly misjudged the distance.  Plates and glasses crash to the floor as, off in the distance, the store manager watches with a crest-fallen expression on his face.
Little Susie decides that she doesn’t want to ride in the shopping cart where her mother placed her.  So, she begins screaming at 95 decibels and crying her little eyes out.  People nearby begin to disperse in order to get away from the ear-piercing noise while mother attempt to negotiate with the child to be quiet.  In the end, mother gives way and puts the child on the floor wherein, the child promptly stops crying and begins running up and down the store isles.
Little Bobby takes the soda from his fast food meal and begin to play airplane with the cup.  Unfortunately, he dips the cup one too many times and the lid departs, sending soda all over the restaurant’s new carpet.  Some patrons stare at the scene while others view the restaurant manager’s angry expression and obvious mumbling under his breath.
We have all probably observed this type of early child behavior.  Assuming that the children in these examples were not suffering from a neurological or medical deficit, what would have been your impression of the parents?

When our children were young many years ago, my wife and I often asked each other why these parents would tolerate their children behaving in such an embarrassing manner.  Some would try to quiet their kids but were unsuccessful.  Others carried the facial expression that showed they had resigned the battle before it ever began – their children were “calling the shots” and running the household.

Did we have that problem in our kids?  How did we solve it in less than two months with no recurrences of the behavior?

140,"Everybody loves toys. No matter what age, if you get a toy you’re filled with an overjoying sense of curiosity. If you are repelled by toys you have some serious issues my friend. Toys have always been a part of childhood growth that also shapes the way a child interacts with and perceives the world outside home. Toys are a great social starter pack as well. To keep occupied a toy however fancy it may be or not, does the trick. New toys not only are exciting but are also a vivid way of enriching kids with essential skills and abilities that are developed simply through channeling focus and dedication to something that is sure to grow on everybody around. Just seeing your son or daughter fly around in a superhero cape is a beautiful sight. Faith in superheroes teaches children more than just admiring people; it also instills a sense of togetherness towards greater good. Such are many other toys that have influences on childhood, developing creativity, perspective, problem solving and promoting learning.
Many toys designed have had a great effect on growing children, equipping them with skills that go along with their play time. What better way to learn than through fun. Before an age where sports begin to dictate growth among peers, fun games and toys can aid in the development of many life skills at a young age.

192,"Hello all,

I've been pretty quiet here for most of this pregnancy but as I approach the end I am getting really scared. My doctor is telling me that even though Twin A is head down I HAVE to have a scheduled c section if Twin B does not turn from breech by August 14. The surgery has already been booked since last week. I am feeling pretty sick over it. My doctor is not comfortable with doing a breech extraction, which I understand, but she has not even brought up the possibility that Twin B might flip after Twin A is born or that she could maybe do an ECV after Twin A is out of the way. I am required to have an epidural and be in the OR for a twin birth anyway. I would be willing to risk a double whammy for the chance of delivering both vaginally.

I've have three successful vaginal births, the twins each have their own sack &amp; placenta, and I don't really want to deal with a prolonged painful recovery if there are other options. I don't want to have to be on antibiotics that might give me and the babies a yeast overgrowth while I try to breastfeed and care for two newborns. I don't want metal staples in my belly (doctor said I HAVE to have staples, sutures are not an option). I really, really don't want to have to take strong painkillers. I used to have a problem with them when I was younger and have a very high tolerance to them so I am afraid that the prescribed dosage will not even work to control the pain of a c section. I don't really trust this doctor as much as I should but this late in my pregnancy switching is not an option. None of the other doctors in town will even give me a second opinion because they need to be able to bill Medicaid for a certain length of time.

Not sure what to do other than continue doing spinning babies exercises and get used to the idea of a c section. I am really frustrated that I hear and read about other women having options that I am not being offered. Last night I was in triage because I hadn't felt one of the babies move all day, and as I was leaving the nurse asked if I was having a natural birth or a c section.

198,"Hello everyone. I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me concerning my daughter. She has mild autism and ADHD. She functions at a high level and does well in social interactions. She only has meltdowns when she is very upset, which is rare. However, for the past couple weeks, she's been randomly soiling herself and I have absolutely no idea why.

The first time it happened, we were in the car coming home from the grocery store. I heard her pass gas, but I smelled that she had an accident. She did not say that she had to use bathroom earlier. I asked her if she had an upset stomach or if anything else was wrong, but she just totally shutdown. She stayed totally silent and sat still while looking down at her feet. When we got home, she was hesitant cleaning up by herself. It was a very messy accident and she was getting overwhelmed, so I just got her cleaned up and dressed myself. Afterwards, she was back to her regular self. I figured it was just a one time accident and didn't think anything of it. 

Three days later, she had an accident just before bedtime. She needed me to clean her up that time as well. The next day she did it at school. She refused to clean herself and didn't want the nurse or anyone else to do it either. She only wanted me and even had a meltdown until I arrived. School was half over and and she obviously was having a bad day, so I just took her home early. She soiled herself again the next morning right as we were leaving to to take her to school. I got her cleaned up and took her to school anyways. She wasn't upset and loves school, so it's not like she was trying not to go.

That's when I decided to put her back in diapers until we get this figured out. I'm glad I did because the accidents became more frequent. Yesterday she made absolutely no attempt at using the bathroom, but today she used the bathroom normally. Whenever she has an accident, she wants me to clean her every time and flat out refuses to do it on her own. 

I just don't know where this came from. She has been fully potty trained since she was 4 years old. I honestly can't remember the last time she wet her pants. The only poop accidents she's had in the past were just from her having diarrhea and just not being able to get to the bathroom in time. She's never done it deliberately like does now.

202,"Hello fellow parents, our almost 2.5 year old refuses to eat by himself. We fully acknowledge that we did this ourselves - my mom lives with us and we occasionally talked about making him eat by himself but never really enforced it. Now during meal times, he refuses to use a spoon or a fork to eat the actual meal, and either pushes his entire plate off of his tray or throws a huge fit. If we don't help him eat, he just won't eat. Or he will sit there and cry and ask for dinner but refuse to eat it by himself.

I know he physically has the dexterity to eat - he can use a fork to eat fruit and use a spoon to eat cereal or apple sauce - but seems only willing to eat by himself for these things and never the actual main course. He also has no problems picking up food like toast and other bite sized items with his hands obviously.

This battle is exhausting, it is ruining dinner time for everyone! Any tips from reddit parents? Would great appreciate any advice.

267,"Hi Everyone.  

Need your advice please on feeding strategies.  Our triplets turn 18 months by end of this month.   Two of our girls are lagging behind in eating solids.   Here's where we are for the two: 

- Still taking bottles (80% regular milk, 20% formula) with plans to transition to 100% milk by October.  they take about 4 feeds / day. 
- They eat pureed food twice a day.  I try to make it as thick as possible (for morning one, I include cottage cheese in the mixed cereal to make it chunky).  They tolerate it well, but I don't notice much chewing action.    Afternoon feed is more smooth than the morning.  
- They don't pick up food and put it in their mouth.  They pick up the food fine, but just don't take it to their mouths.  I'm working with them daily to bring finger foods and sit and let them watch me eat some of the food.   Based on what I read online, I don't force them to eat, but let them watch and let them explore. No progress.  One holds on to the food in her hand, the other would try to nibble on the food, but eventually throws it away.   
- They don't hold sippie cups and won't even drink from it even If we try to feed them.  

We'll be seeing the pediatrician for their 18month checkup soon, and I'm considering asking for both of the kids to start therapy to improve their feeding.  

This is extremely frustrating and exhausting, and I need some advice on what has worked for you:

- For any of you who has gone through this struggle,  kindly share any tips that has worked, and how long did it take to notice change? 
- When is the best time to offer solids?  I read in forums on trying foods when they're hungry, very hungry. I think of the 1st morning feed as best option, but haven't tried it yet.  Do you recommend this?  or between feeds when when're not really that hungry?   
- any particular foods that worked well for your kids?

274,"Hi Moms. I need your input. My daughter's diaper rash is becoming seriously frustrating. At the beginning of November, we had to switch childcare providers (due to our previous one moving out of the area.) We like our new provider very much but almost immediately our daughter had a diaper rash show up. Previous to this, she hardly had any issues. It was also around the same time that we gradually switched from breastmilk to cow's milk but the first two weeks, she was still entirely on breastmilk and the rash was present then. Over the past two months, we've looked at a myriad of causes. However, one fact seems to remain the same: The diaper rash gets worse at the sitters and almost immediately gets better in our care (within one or two diaper changes). There is another little boy at the same providers and his parents are dealing with the same thing. We took a week vacation around Thanksgiving where the rash was entirely cleared up but within a day of being at the providers home, it showed back up. 

How would you approach this? Any ideas on what could be causing it? Could it be a lotion or soap that the provider is using? We've talked with the provider about it and she does not seem concerned about it and thinks diaper rash happens. I'm to the point where I want to start looking for another provider.

First time posting here!

So: I'm a first time mom and my beautiful girl is a little over 5 months old. She's exclusively breastfed. 

I used to be able to pump no problem. I'm a SAHM for now, but pumping let my husband in on feeding, as well as gave me some freedom.

The first time I suddenly wasn't able to pump, I inspected everything and noticed I had a hole in the diaphragm. There's your problem! Called Medela (i have a double pump from them) and they were wonderful. Had a new one in like a day.

The new pump was working great!....at first. Didn't turn it up all the way anymore, even bought myself a great handsfree bra. I was making on average 4oz per session (i usually pumped once a day at night after she was asleep).

Now suddenly I'm putting the pump at max and I'm getting dribbles out. If I hand express milk flows freely! But on the pump my foremilk starts for like 10 seconds and then stops and I never let down.

Changed flange sizes, membrabes are good, no diaphragm holes this time. I don't know what to do :(

332,"How do you define child support without lawyers (never married)? Ex is about to start working and we are looking for childcare but I am unsure how to cover costs. Since breakup (mid-July) I take 20% out of each biweekly paycheck ~$400 to go to an account for him, also covering Health Insurance. When we split up I gave her half of our (my) savings (~$7k) and also she got half of signing bonus from my new job 4 months after breakup (~2.2k). She is primary care giver and I have him (no overnights yet) 80% of weekends and see him 2 add'l nights during the week. After childcare starts I assume we will be splitting weekends more often because she will not be with him all day like she is currently.  She will be making probably 40% less than I am at her new job and adding additional costs (commuting 80 minutes by car/train). 

FWIW here is the background. 
Background:
My ex and I were dating for four years, engaged for almost two, lived together for two.  Moved to new city together, I started working, found out she was pregnant, she stayed home due to a difficult 9 months of sickness. DS finally comes and she continued to stay at home with him and I worked. I paid for everything, including her student loans, car insurance (not health insurance).  We split up (trust me, It was for the best), at my choosing. She knew I was unhappy for a while. 

So, she moved back to her parents house two states away, took DS with her. I imagined it working out differently (week here - week there), but I was naive.

363,"I am lost and in need of some outside perspective.

Some background:  My husband and I joined the military together in 2009.  By 2012, my husband had been injured and was receiving at 60% disability rating from the military, and I was pregnant.  We sat down and agreed on our perspective roles - He said he wanted to be the SAHP and take care of our baby, while I said that was fine, I would get a job and support us.  We discussed what the SAHP job entails for me to be happy...

Our son taken care of (fed, cleaned, clothed, entertained), the laundry, dishes and the house kept livable. (I am not a clean freak by any means, but I do expect that bathrooms are cleaned once every other month or so...)  I got a job working Graveyard shift at a hospital and our son was diagnosed with Autism at age 2.  He is now 4 and was recently enrolled in very expensive private school specifically for autistic children.   

Now the reality:  My husband will lock my son into his room for hours on end.  I would say my 4 year old spends the majority of his time playing on the IPAD.  During that time my husband will spend hours playing video games in a adjacent room.  I do not believe my husband has cleaned a bathroom once since my sons' birth (its gets bad, I yell, he ignores, defeated I do it myself - cycle continues next time it gets bad)  I am unsure why we even bothered buying a dresser as my husband believes clothes do not need to be folded/put away - if they are clean but slightly damp (because he realized all our clothes were dirty and started 1 load of laundry a few hours before I needed to go to work) that's good enough.  *BTW - going to work at 10 pm in damp clothes on winter nights is the best treat ever!* And he has taken to buying big stacks of paper plates so he has something clean to eat off of because the sink is usually full of dirty dishes.

I have tried talking to him, his mother has come up, seen our place and tried talking to him, he will promise to do better and a week later everything is the same.  If and when I complain about it, he tells me ""I'm hurt and can't do the chores"" ""if you want it done, you do it"" or ""why don't you do more work around here then?""

Society seems to blame me for his shortcomings.  When my husband is late to pick up my son from school, I get a phone call asking when I will be there (in the middle of when I am sleeping of course), when my husband fails to make doctor appointments and keep them, the offices phone me and want commitments which I cant give them without either not sleeping or not going to work.  When people see how my son is living they look at me with disgust and ask me how am I allowing this to happen...

I feel completely trapped and helpless.  I love my husband but I feel like he is using me to enable his bad behavior and I don't feel like there is anything I can do about it.  People I have talked to have suggested just letting things go until he picks up on the fact that I'm not going to bail him out, however this means the house becomes a disaster as he doesn't get that ""hint"".  I have threatened divorce, he shrugs.  I believe he knows that I cant leave him without further harming my son.  (How do you take care of a autistic child when you work all night and sleep half the day without massive amounts of money to pay for specialized childcare?)

I, myself, suffer from depression.  I often have thoughts of ending it but again, that would only hurt my son.  So day after day I muddle along.

395,"I had my baby 7 weeks ago by non-elective caesarean after 3 days of labour. While I would never judge anyone for having a caesarean, elective or not, I was devastated as I'd really been looking forward to experiencing a vaginal birth. I didn't expect it to be pleasant, but I wanted to do it! While I understand the decision was made in the best interest of my baby and me, I'm still sad about the outcome, and my midwife is organising a review with the delivering obstetrician so that I can hear all the cold hard medical facts from the person who made the call and ask him the questions I wish I'd thought to ask at the time.

I plan to ask:

* exactly why they weren't willing to let me continue labouring
why he thinks I had so much trouble dilating in my own and why swelling on both my cervix and baby's head became an issue when we did eventually make progress
* why he said I would be a good candidate for a vbac next time (he gave reasons but I was crying and don't remember them)
* what can I expect when attempting a vbac (as in, I want to have reasonable expectations next time rather than just latching onto the positives)

I don't want to be thinking of more questions after the meeting and wishing I'd thought of them earlier so, if you had a non-elective caesarean, what questions would you want answered? 

What I didn't mention in my original post (though it's probably very obvious) is that I would dearly love to achieve a vbac for our next (and last) baby. So I really have two reasons for requesting this review: 1. I'm hoping that I can be more accepting of the c-section and 2. I want to manage my expectations for next time. Maybe I'm not a good candidate for a vbac and if so, I want to know this now so I'm well-prepared for it when the time comes.

Thanks to the posters at C-section Central, I've added the following questions to my list:

* Did the OB use a single or double layer of stitches to close up the incision?
* How long should I wait before trying to get pregnant again?
* What are the criteria for being considered as a candidate for a vbac?

I have until now sheltered my kids from any money problems and political dissidence.  That changed for my oldest, 11, when SOPA became an issue.

Now, this one is easy.  They aren't computer oriented much yet, so this law doesn't effect them.  But it got me thinking.  When is the right time to open up the world as it is to a child?

It would be nice for her (and eventually my husband) to be able to have quality time alone (feeding) the baby and even nicer for me to be able to get out and have a life. Therefore, I'm considering introducing the bottle once or twice a day. 

I have heard conflicting advice on this. Some say that the baby will start refusing the breast (Not sure if this will be a problem for us...for now, the baby seems happy to engage in sucking motions when she's starving.) The pediatrician said that if I'm still exclusively breastfeeding at 3 months, the risk is that the baby will refuse the bottle. Therefore, she advises introducing the bottle from time to time. 

Friends tell me that pumping and dealing with washing and warming up bottles is a pain and I should keep breastfeeding until it's really become a problem for me. 

Any advice on if it's worth it for me to introduce the bottle now or is the baby really too young?

Last night I went to a training session for work and my SO, MIL, and FIL stayed home with my 7 week old beautiful baby girl. My SO went to mow the lawn, it's been the first few nice days here, and left my MIL to watch the LO. I guess my SO came back to find that our LO had been crying for 15 minutes while grandma was holding her, and she had no clue what to do. Lucky my SO knows her cries very well and knew she was hungry. But come on! The first thing you think of when a baby cries is that they chould be hungry. She claims that she didn't know where we keep the formula... It's right on the counter next to the clean bottles. Does she think I have time to hide it away in the cupboard??? Also if she was so confused why would she have not flagged down my SO, who was outside?!? She claims she raised my SO, as well as his 3 cousins. But I'm not sure how this can be true.

453,"I posted a bit ago about finally getting my BFP!! We were so excited as we had been trying for almost two years!
even though we were on a road trip and forever away from home. 

Once we got home, I went to the doctor to confirm it (I had already taken 4 hpt that all came back definite +).  Doc confirmed the pregnancy and within half an hour I got a sharp pain in my left side and started bleeding :(

Straight to emerg we went. The ultrasound showed nothing since I was only 5 weeks and we were instructed to come back in the morning for a trans vaginal. 
The next morning we came back and they couldn't see anything in my uterus and we were told to prepare for an ectopic. Since my vitals were good and I wasn't in excruciating pain the gyno asked if we were ok with the expected management method (wait and see). We said ok and were sent home. Once we got home I laid down only to get very dizzy so back to emerg we went. 
I later found out that I had a moderate amount of blood in my pelvis. I was offered surgery and declined. I, for some reason felt as though my body knew what it was doing and I would be okay. I was admitted and watched for the next two days. 

Everything stabilized and I was still offered the surgery. I said no again. I was then sent home and told to take it easy and to come back if I was in pain. I haven't been in pain all week and I'm just waiting for my hcg to go back to 0. 

I don't know where to go from here :(
I'm happy that I didn't need surgery and I'm alive. Will I soon get emotional about losing the baby? I don't know what I'm feeling and it's scary!

473,"I usually call it shepherd's pie, but my husband vehemently reminds me that shepherd's pie uses lamb, not beef...and it's really hard to find lamb out here.

So, Cottage Pie:
Ground beef
stewed tomatoes
carrots
yellow onion
chicken or beef broth (if you're a parent, it depends on whatever you have in the cupboard some nights)
flour (I have Celiac, so I either use rice flour or cornstarch)
milk or cream (whatever you have on hand)
russet potatoes
kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil

First you get a pot of potatoes going to make mashed potatoes.  Now, I have a few ways of doing this: sometimes I just put them in the steamer in my rice cooker.  Less water, less mess, takes about 20 minutes.  OR, lately I've been putting them in my pressure cooker, which takes about 10 minutes, plus I can add more potatoes to it.  Or you can just boil them on the stove.  Either way, get that going.

Then start browning the beef to almost finished with the kosher salt (don't mess around with table salt.  Use it to make homemade playdoh, but get kosher salt for cooking), pepper, basil and garlic powder.  Then add the can of stewed tomatoes, chopped onion, chopped carrots and put the lid on and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  Just to get the carrots soft.

Then take a cup of broth and heat it in the microwave for 30sec.  Then add the flour/cornstarch to it and whisk until blended.  Add this to the pot, and pour in about 1/2c of milk.  Just mix this until the liquid is bubbling and turn the stove off, but keep the pot on the burner.

Now turn your oven on to 400F and get out a deep casserole dish.  Or a casserole dish.  Or something that can go in the oven...I kind of need a kitchen make-over in this area.  So you put the meat/veg mixture into the dish, and pat it down with a spoon (don't use your fingers...it's hot.  Just saying.).  Then mash your potatoes to pretty creamy, and put that on top of the meat/veg.  

Now, if you have PAM on hand, spray the top of the potatoes.  I've tried using butter, but it doesn't coat it very evenly.  Absolutely do not use the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray.  That stuff is freaking evil.  And it doesn't work for this.

So then put it in the oven for about 15 or so minutes, or until the top of the potatoes is pretty golden.  

The great thing about this dish is that it is really versatile.  You can put whatever you want in it and mix it up.  So if you guys actually like mashed cauliflower, you could put that on top (I actually gagged when I tried mashed cauliflower, so that is never happening here).

558,"If you're a straight haired person parenting a curly haired child, you might have noticed that curly hair is an entirely different beast than straight hair. Hair techniques that you use on yourself, just don't work and the kiddo is left with frizz or looking like a mad scientist. Kids know when people are staring at them, and nothing causes stares like a crazy hair day. For a kid already dealing with the issues of being adopted or in foster care, this can cause more feelings of ""I don't fit in"". Luckily, there are things you can do as a parent to help.

It's ok to admit to you're out of your depth. Curly hair is tricky. Many hairdressers aren't accustomed to curls and won't always know what to do outside of washing and straightening them. [This website](https://www.devacurl.com/salon-stylist-search.html) can help you look for a stylist who is used to curls and can give you tutorials on a kids day to day hair styling.

The main takeaway I'd say for a child is never brush dry. You'll create frizz and it will most likely hurt the child's hair causing a tantrum. At bathtime, comb the tangles with a [wide-tooth comb](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Tooth-Detangle-Shampoo-Unbreakable/dp/B005NI80RY). Then add the product and air dry, towel dry with a [microfiber towel](https://www.amazon.com/Quickie-49024RM-Microfiber-Towel-24-Pack/dp/B005BGCI8K) (sorry for the amazon links, I couldn't find examples that didn't lead to a sales page) or old cotton t-shirt. Try to avoid touching the hair afterwards, that makes it frizzy. There are [special pillow cases](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-7-best-silk-pillowcases-for-curly-hair-62830) that help curly hair not get damaged and frizzy in the night. Types and amounts of product will vary based on the kids hairstyle and even the humidity of where you live. You may never get the same style two days in a row. It happens.

Right here on Reddit, /r/curlyhair can offer a lot of advice. [Naturallycurly.com](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curly-hair/curls) is also a great resource. If you can find the kids hair-type, you can look on youtube for tutorials, like ""long 3C hair, how to manage frizz"". As mentioned above, a good salon is the best place to take a kid. If the only salons in your area that are curl friendly are predominately black, and you (or even you and the kid) are white don't feel awkward in the slightest. Mention straight out you're looking for advice in taking care of the kids hair. They will be happy to help. Some salons offer a ""tutorial"" session that will be charged like another cut would be. In my experience, these are extensive and worth the money.

So to wrap it up, if you're fostering or have adopted a child with curly hair it can be easy to be overwhelmed with taking care of it. That said, there are many resources to help you learn how to manage your kids hair.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

579,"I’ll preface this by saying I know we are only three days in, so I’m not expecting perfection. 

My son (34 months) is on day three of potty training. We’re doing “cold turkey”, no diapers except at bedtime. 

Day one: nothing but accidents. He peed EVERYWHERE. If we got him to sit on the potty AT ALL it was a huge victory. He stayed dry through a two hour nap though, so we know at least his bladder has a pretty good capacity. 

Day two: Rough morning, but willing to sit on the potty. Dry through nap time then, eureka! After his nap he started shouting “I need to poop!” and running to the toilet. (Side note, pooping usually takes several tries throughout the day for him, so I think that he was actually identifying a need to poop, then only peeing). No accidents for the rest of the day!

Day three (today): Back to HATING the idea of even sitting on the potty. Refused all morning. Dry through nap time, but almost didn’t make it to the potty because he refused to use it (he hid in the closet and kept telling me no). Now he’ll voluntarily use the potty, but the entire afternoon/evening he’ll shout “I had an accident!” then run to the potty and finish the last few drops there. 

I appreciate that he’s identifying his accidents and trying to get to the toilet, but we haven’t had any real successes today. And, I don’t know how to treat prizes when this happens. I don’t want to reward an accident, but I do want to praise him for trying to get to the potty. I also don’t want him to feel defeated because he is trying.

Going out is ruining my enthusiasm for it. This weekend we took all 3 kids out. The oldest has always attracted his own attention. We went to the mall to look for shoes.

Since about a week in, my husband and I have slept in different rooms with one twin each because if one wakes up, the whole family wakes up. It’s honestly worked really well for us and we don’t feel too sleep deprived. The problem is I’m still getting up every 4 hours to pump and my twin always wakes up when I do so I have to feed them (they don’t latch so we bottle feed) and it ends up taking about an hour to get back to sleep. The twin with my husband usually makes it to 4, 5, or even 6 am before needing a bottle. 

They nap in their room but one is so fidgety and noisy that she wakes the other. We spend the whole nap staring at the baby monitor and running in at the first grunt to try and keep the other one asleep. The grunty one is actually a good sleeper but her sister wakes at the slightest floorboard creek. Of course, right?

829,"So I am due on the 26th of December with my di/di twin boys. This is my third viable pregnancy. I wanted a home birth with my midwife but I understand that giving birth at the hospital is in the best interest of myself and my boys. 

That bring said, I live a 10 minute drive from my local hospital, theybhavr an OBS clinic and it's where I gave birth to my first( super traumatic e experience which resulted in PPD and a mental breakdown months after). 

Twin pregnancy automatically puts me in a highrisk category, but as far as that goes I am the lowest risk for all of that. Two successful spontaneous labour and vaginal deliveries with no complications medically. No other highrisk factors are present in this pregnancy, and I am a good candidate to theoretically vaginally deliver both babies provided they remain healthy and not in distress. 

Be cause I have a midwife, shenwill be in charge of my delivery at the hospital unless I intervention and then she is there as the second attendant. Now suddenly the local hospital is refusing to let me give birth there because of ""staff shortage"" which is total BS. They don't need two MDs because the midwife is there as the second. They want me to travel tons hospital in the city that is about an hour plus away. 

Here is my problem: I have two children age 9 and 2.5, who knows what time of day I'll go into labour  I am guessing it's going to take 30-60 minutes to make all the arrangements when the time comes to get ahold of the people and set our plan in place for the children to be taken care of. Second problem: my labours are hard and fast, I'm talking NO breaks between contractions, just constant peeks and building up to stronger more painful contractions the ENTIRE TIME. I am estimating that depending on traggic and the ongoing highway construction it will be another hour and 45 minutes to to the hospital, bot to even mention thebdamn registration and finding a place to park. Third problem : the weather ! No idea if there will be a snow storm. We don't have friends or family we can stay with leading up to the due date, we can't afford a hotel room and Neal's for who knows how long. Husband still has to work, oldest has to go to school. I am terrified of traveling away from home, tondeliver in an unfamiliar hospital with doctors I haven't met and not being able to have my midwife with me ( stupid jurisdiction rules). Not to mention my labours are quick as in under 4 hours from water breaking to holding baby in my arms quick. So I am scared of having these babies on the side of the road and there being complications. 

This is causing me a lot of anxiety and stress, I can't sleep at night because of all the worry. And having suffered PPD/A after both pregnancies,  zi feel this experience will be detrimental to my mental health.

832,"So I had my son April 3rd, he was born at 7lb 14oz.  The hospital told me to give him 1 oz every 4 hours,  and I did that for the first day. He does fine with his formula so far -  no spit up,  doesn't act fussy,  his poops are seedy and aren't too solid, and he doesn't get too gassy.  I do burp him every half an oz or so,  though.  Anyways,  starting the second day he started getting very very fussy after he ate his oz. We gave him a pacifier and it seemed to quell that problem.  However,  sometimes it doesn't work and I can tell he is still hungry.  He'll spit out his pacifier and root around,  try to suck his hand,  stick out his tongue,  ect.  

The hospital got angry at me for topping off with a few extra ml. They told me I was going to over feed him.  This confused me,  because I thought infants need to be fed on demand. 

Now,  at home,  he's not acting satisfied until he gets about 2 Oz every 2-4 hours.  I don't want to overfeed him,  and his pediatrician appointment isn't until Thursday so I'm not really sure what to do.

838,"So I'm a 21yo, SAH, first time mom. My son is going to be 9mo in about 2 weeks. I grew up with strict authoritarian, emotionally abusive parents and as a result, I battle with depression and rage/agression. I'm short tempered and often impatient.

I'm scared that one day I won't be able to pull myself away in time.

841,"So I'm in the unfortunate situation of awaiting some test results after finding out that our cute little baby (which looks normal to me on a 12 week ultrasound) actually is at high risk for a number of chromosomal issues, the most common of which is Down's Syndrome.

The NT measurement came back 3.0mm. Upon second measurement at the genetic office, the measurement came back 3.1mm. We are 12 weeks plus a few days.

My wife and I have made the decision that we're not going to end the pregnancy based on any kind of disability, but it would be nice to know and have time to prepare. We're currently awaiting the California State Screening test, which includes PAPP-A and HCG, which combined with age should give us some kind of % likelihood for defect.

Following that, we'll be conducting an NIPT test which will let us know with high accuracy the likelihood there is something wrong. We probably won't move forward with a CVS or amnio unless there is a very compelling reason.

Scary to say the least and I can't stop thinking about it, but I'm hoping and praying that everything is fine and normal. The genetic counselor tells us that with JUST the high NT measurement, no other factors included, the likelihood of something being wrong is 1/5. 

In all honestly, if the baby has an intellectual disability, then so be it. My wife and I will manage! I am worried about the baby having other issues. Heart problems, organ problems, if she won't live once she's born. Those thoughts really make me sad.

Single mum and her baby, currently around 8 months old.

Dad is other side of the country, so he's around and he facetimes baby, gets pictures, but wont be able to physically visit too often. Every few weeks, at best, really. 

So there is a worry that if we keep seeing eachother, slowly as the baby gets older she will consider me her dad, and call me that, in the absence of seeing her actual dad as often as me. Now of course, when she gets older it can be explained, but for a long while it might be confusing. 

I dont have a problem with that in itself, only that i dont want to hurt the baby as she grows up, or confuse her, or upset her or anything like that, because of course like any potential relationship, it might just not work and i could ""disappear"".. and im not trying to take the place of her dad. 

The trouble is for various reasons due to her mum and dads work, she doesnt have the chance for them to babysit a whole lot, so the time we would like to spend together either needs to involve the baby, or needs to be cut drastically down to when she can get them to babysit. .. and in reality that could be once every 2 or 3 weeks which would put a strain on us in a way, but i understand if thats how it needs to be.

We used a nipple shield for the first 2 weeks, which he had difficulty latching to as well, pushing my supply even further into the ground. I did not have access to a pump these first 2 weeks as there was an insurance issue and my company would not allow me to pre order my pump. at 2 weeks I was able to get a hygeia pump, however I was only pumping a 1/2 oz between my two breasts. I was able to visit with another LC who was able to get my son to latch without a nipple shield and started us on an SNS tube. We have been breast feeding with an SNS tube until last week (then dry pumping for 20 minutes), when for some reason he stopped latching properly with the tube. He is however latching properly breast only. Currently we are breastfeeding, then supplementing with a bottle. After the breast feed, I dry pump for 20 minutes. Today I skipped breast feeding and gave my son a bottle while I double pumped to see if I could figure out exactly how much I'm getting, and my stomach dropped when I could only get an oz, and could not wrangle a 2nd let down.

The second portion of mediation was today. Because BM made a big deal about my being there last time, I didn't go for moral support. I wish I had.

Apparently, it was a shit show. BM got something in the mail from the state about child support, and the mediator *would not shut up about it*. The current parenting plan specifically states that neither party pays child support; that's not even up for discussion. That's not something SO was addressing as an issue that needs resolved. ~~But *we're* the money-hungry ones who only want primary for the money; bitch, please.~~

Also, for some reason, the mediator thinks that BM should get an uninterrupted week during the summer. *Seriously?* Aside from 3 weekends a month and half the holidays, she has *so much more time with them* that's uninterrupted. Is SO going to get an uninterrupted week or two during the school year? No? *~~Then fuck off!~~

I'm *fuming*. But at the same time, heartbroken. It's like nothing we do to try and make life better for the girls is acknowledged, or even allowed.

We can't afford a lawyer. We can't afford to pay for a GAL (who, according to the mediator, would just side with BM). We couldn't really afford mediation (and definitely not having to pay twice even though we were under the impression the fee was for the whole court ordered amount of time, not just the first half).

I just don't know what to do anymore. We tried to *improve* things **for the girls** Ina way that would make things easier *for BM* (who will soon have a newborn on top of her special needs kid).

1077,"tl;dr - Have been co-sleeping with my 7mo old son and I've gotten addicted to the ease of being able to nurse him back to sleep. How easy/hard was it to transition baby back to crib?

Some background.. My son is almost 7 months old. Between when he was about 3 1/2 months to 5 1/2 months, he was sleeping in his crib. At first, it was difficult to get him to fall asleep (and stay asleep) but it's gotten progressively better. For the few weeks before he turned 6 months, he would simply fall asleep nursing and I would then just transfer him to his crib. He'd wake up twice throughout the night and I'd nurse him back to sleep. After the second time, usually around 5am, I would just let him finish sleeping in my bed. That was my ideal situation and I thought we had finally gotten a good night routine.

However, in the past few weeks, he started to wake up more frequently and was harder to transfer into the crib. He would wake up the second his head touched the crib mattress or within an hour of putting him down. It made me so tired that it eventually led us to co-sleeping. At first, I blamed his crappy sleep on the 6 month sleep regression. Then I blamed it on teething. Now, I'm blaming it on the 6 month vaccinations he received yesterday. 

I love co-sleeping because it's so easy for me to nurse LO back to sleep if he wakes up. But regardless of whether or not I shot myself in the foot and let LO (and myself) get comfy with co-sleeping or if it's because of a regression/teething/vaccinations, I want my bed back! I'm getting about the same number of hours of sleep but I'm sleeping so much more comfortably without him there. Other than just being persistent with putting him back in his crib to sleep, does anyone have tips/success stories of going from co-sleeping to crib? And would I be doing more harm than good transitioning slowly (because eventually, I'm going to run out of excuses for his crappy sleep)?",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False
