15,"Hello Community. 

We have a 5yr daughter and a 6yr old son. We're often outside in the nature the whole day for a hike or do camping in the wilderness for a night, and of course the kids have to do a wee or a poop then (We live in a country where it's not a crime). 

My girl learned by herself to pee outside sitting down with her bottom flat on the ground with her legs outstretched. It's the most comfortable way for her and in contrast to squatting she can do it this way without wetting herself or her clothes. 

The problem starts when she has to do a poop too. She sits down completely too then, because she has to pee at first and then she sits down there, strains and pushes and tries hard to get ""it"" out but without success. I feel so sorry for her because it's obvious everytime that she really needs to go, she pushes and pushes and tells that she's feeling the poo tryin' and being so close to get out but not making it, and then she keeps pushing and trying until she can't do it anymore and gives up successlessly with the pressure still inside her.   
 The longest time we spent to have her trying was about 30 minutes but she didn't make to squeeze ""it"" out underneath herself. 

Does anybody know a way how to encourage her to make it? She totally refuses to squat down or to sit on a log. She wants to do it like she always does it, she says...

My baby is 3 weeks old today. He took to my breasts great from the beginning and has steadily been gaining weight. The problem is that I’m producing way too much milk for our needs. I only pump to relieve pain/fullness and to prevent things like mastitis &amp; clogged ducts. I’m able to take LO to work with me every day (self-employed), so I don’t really need a huge freezer stash...just a small one for babysitters &amp; for my husband to give a bottle every now and then. 

I’ve only been pumping for 2.5 weeks now and have 600oz in my freezer stash. I can’t keep going at this rate...it’s exhausting, it’s painful, space is limited, and we don’t even need a huge stash to begin with. 

I’m not wanting to fully stop my milk production, just reduce it a bit to a more manageable level. I hear Sudafed works, but I’m afraid that will make me dry up completely which isn’t the goal. I just want to produce less.

29,"Hi there. About 2 weeks ago I made the tough decision to begin exclusively pumping because my LO is a seriously crappy nurser. Since then I've been pumping 9-10 times per day. I pump every 2-2.5 hours during the day and get a 4 hour stretch at night. I get about 26oz on most days, while LO eats anywhere from 24-30. I supplement with formula when I don't have enough milk to give her.

I'm taking Mothers Love More Milk Plus and Domperidone, and am eating lactation cookies like nobody's business.

I'm wondering if anyone knows if/how I can reduce the number of pumping sessions each day without reducing my already anemic supply. I'd like to condense down to maybe 4-6 pumping sessions per day because at some point I have to go back to work and there is no way I can continue to pump every 2 hours or so during the day.

42,"I was hoping someone here may have had some success or advice on how to help us. Sorry in advance for the long winded post. Our beautiful daughter is finally home after a 1 month NICU stay for the repair/re-route of duodenal atresia as well as AVSD repair on 8/28. We’ve been working on her oral feeding. 

Initially, when our daughter was in the hospital, she was only taking the bottle. The doctors said her intake needs to be 60ml each feed- if she took 40ml orally, then she’d get 20ml through her NG via gravity feeding. However, when she came home, she began to refuse the bottle. We tried for 15/20 minutes to get her to take the bottle, and it came to a point where she stopped gaining weight because she was fighting so hard. We were at a loss. So we began to breastfeed with clearance from the doctors. 

Since then, she nurses for 10/15 minutes consistently, although she does have bad days where she won’t nurse at all and we will have to give her the full 60ml via gravity through the NG. We have also been given the NICU guidelines that we have been encouraged to use for supplementation. Every time we use this gauge, she pukes up whatever we seem to supplement her through the NG. If we let her nurse to her hearts content, there is no puking. If we nurse her on the right side, then offer her the left, she pukes up what she thinks she gets from the left.

We went to the doctors again, they told us that our daughter needed to nurse longer than the 10/15 minutes, and said she wasn’t getting enough by mouth. We tried to explain to them our situation with the bottle and supplementing, and they said that we need to do pre and post feed weights in order to make sure she’s getting the 60ml they want her to intake. They want us to get a scale so we have exact measurements on how to supplement her. We feel like she might be getting exactly what she needs with each nursing session, but it is hard to quantify since we can’t actually see how much she’s getting. 

Has anyone had any experience in obtaining a scale? What has worked for you nursing moms? Is it possible that she actually IS getting the 60ml she needs in the 10-15 minutes? Why can’t we trust our daughter will nurse enough? 

With our first child, we always let her nurse until she was satisfied and never had this issue, and we totally understand that having Down syndrome makes this an entirely different ball game. We are trying to understand both sides of the coin. We know that children with Down syndrome have nursing problems, and weight issues. She latches great and only breaks away when she’s done- even nursing through her let downs. Any advice? Any stories that might help? We just want her to thrive and to hopefully avoid a G tube. If she needs one, she will get one, but she showed so much promise in the hospital that our doctors and us would love to try and avoid one. She was taking the entire 60ml twice a day, and her lowest feed was 20ml.

We are so obsessed with her getting 60ml and having her nurse for 20/25 minutes it has been driving both of us crazy, and myself into a depression. I don’t know how to let this go. 

She’s supplemented with Elecare to 26 calories. She has been gaining a half ounce every day. 

Since she’s shown so much promise with oral feeding, we want to avoid a g tube, but we have so much anxiety that it will head in that direction. Not that a g tube is bad, but we already had her have two major surgeries in two months and would love to avoid it. We have read about the benefits of breastfeeding for children with Down syndrome and we want that for our daughter so badly. 

Today we noticed she latches and sucks great but doesn’t swallow?

**Back story**

Her father and I are young.  I was 17 when I got pregnant, didn't know what to do, **that** story, we've all heard or experienced it.  Her father and I were together for 5 years before getting pregnant and the first half of the pregnancy was amazing.  Second half... not so much.  To make that shitty long story short:

He started cheating, became verbally, emotionally and even physically abusive near the end of my pregnancy.

My dumb, young, naive ass thought it was pregnancy stress on him, stayed with him. (Poor choice on my part, I know)

He and I split the day she was born and he'd have her every other weekend until she was 18 months, has not seen her since then due to a drug addiction.

_____________________________________

**STORY STARTS HERE**

Since spending time exclusively with her father when she was younger she is afraid of men.  She also rips all of her hair out, picks at her skin and is REALLY below average for weight because she won't eat (I'm talking barely second percentile here).  Her pediatrician says it's likely anxiety due to the hostile living situation with her father, but that there's nothing we can do because she's 2 and a therapist won't do anything.

Does anyone have toddlers with anxiety? How do you cope and manage?  I'm really afraid for her, she's hurting herself..

Thank you in advance, guys!♥

On the 27th of September I was 9 days late for my period. I have a copper coil in place and was only tired and thought I had a cold. I am trying to lose weight so I assumed I had missed a period due to losing a little too much last month. Plus my boyfriend and I only had sex once last month. We took a test and it almost instantly came up positive. I went to the pharmacy to get two more and they two popped up almost instantly with positives. I was in hysterics crying and feeling scared. I felt so guilty and it just felt unreal.


We made an appointment for that afternoon due to the iud and my GP made a referral for a OBGYN for the next day. We went and had an ultrasound and didn't see anything , the coil was removed (it was too low in my womb which caused it to be ineffective) and we had blood work done.

Our OBGYN told us that if our HCG steadily raised over a week that we were probably safe and to come back Thursday for blood work and the following Friday for another ultrasound. That afternoon my HCG levels where already 2000 and he said he wanted to see us first thing Monday. We researched what was going on and everything said we were high risk for an ectopic and that just sent me into primal stress mode. 


This morning we had our appointment and the doctor did the ultrasound straight away. We saw the sac in my womb and instantly I was relieved to know baby an I are safe. Our OBGYN informed us of where an abortion clinic in our town is and also gave us an appointment for a checkup with him in two weeks, in case we decide to move ahead with this pregnancy. I feel like I've been in shock and haven't really had time to process what's going on.


We talked about our options a bit and my boyfriend doesn't think we are ready. We live in a foreign country in a two-bedroom apartment where the rental agreement runs out on my due date, I hate my job and it's not in the field that I studied for but working within that field means I either have to travel to the city or learn the language, we are looking into buying but we're waiting on selling his apartment in his home country.

I feel so guilty and don't want to do it at all. I would love to give this baby to a family who could love and care for it but my boyfriend won't even entertain the idea and now I just hate myself because I know the logical solution but my heart just can't do it.

50,"Lately, I feel that I am emotionally shallow.

My wife has brought to my attention that I don't really seem to care much about our soon to be son. (15.5 weeks today)

When I remember that I am about to have a baby, I am happy.

I love thinking that he weighs 2oz, and is the size of an orange.

I love seeing the tiny bump he has made on my wife's belly.

But I don't find myself looking to Predaddit, Daddit, or Baby Bumps for advice.

I can't ever really get into reading the books.

My wife calls the baby, ""Little Bear."" I've noticed that its even hard to call the baby anything other than ""it.""

My wife seems to have a great joy looking to all these sources. She had a wonderful(?) time researching, and preparing, and learning. But it seems like every time I try to do the same I become distracted. I know she needs a partner to make this actually enjoyable for her. I know she deserves to be able to talk to me about this stuff.

I've started to think that I do this same thing with my relationship as a whole. I hear that she is having a problem, and I just don't attach the appropriate amount of emotional weight to it. 

It's like I've set up emotional blockers all my life and I am having trouble tearing them down with my wife and kid. I love them both. But I have a hard time instinctual doing what is best for them, or accepting that my instincts may not always be the most appropriate. I think I always figured that I would get new instincts regarding wife and kid the same way you get adult teeth, it happens no matter what. But sometimes I feel like I have the wife and the kid on the way but something inside me is having a hard time letting go of the past.

If I'm honest with myself I think it's because I'm immature, and am waiting to ""wake up."" But it's like I already know that there is no ""wake up."" That I just have to do it. So how did the other predads (or Dads) here start to do it? Did you just know how to act? 

I know this post may be more suited for r/relationships, but the community here seems more family oriented, and I am about to be a dad. I don't really know what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting. Maybe some of you have went through the same. Maybe someone found out how to get better.

My niece is so unappreciative of what she has, we've tried everything from reasoning with her to taking the luxuries she has, she has Netflix, a laptop, a phone, foxtel (cable tv) xbox. Now you can say there's the issue she is spoiled, the laptop and phone aren't top of the line but they are enough to do what she needs to do for contact and school work.

The problem is she doesn't care, we take the phone away from her laptop she says she doesn't care and she actually doesn't which defeats the purpose of punishment we've tried just about everything with her, she is so lazy getting her to do the basic of things is impossible.

71,"Since a young age, my niece (9, female) hasn't been great at respecting other people's property.



When she was six she would often come home with other children's toys, or the teacher's phone etc. At that age, items were returned and it was all understood as part of a six year olds normal developmental misbehavior.



However, as she has aged the behaviour has not stopped.



On outings, she will steal lollies. She continues to take property belonging to others. She doesn't seem to understand that this behaviour is wrong. When caught, she will deny everything and protest her innocence even when caught Red handed. When punished she will sulk and present herself as the wronged party unjustly accused.



Similarly, she fiercely guards treats from her sisters. She will sit next to a bowl of chips I may have set out for them when they visit, and react angrily when her sisters take two chips at once. Then she will sneak great handfuls when she thinks no one is looking.  She has an intense dislike of any benefit that she does not share (for example, it is unfair when her sister succeeds at sport).




She is otherwise a lovely and intelligent child but these behaviours, to me, speak of a selfish /self centred streak. I am concerned about her development as an upstanding person.




As her uncle I've spoken to her mother, my sister, who agrees there is an issue but didn't know how to proceed. My brother in law doesn't see these behaviours as problematic, however, and even seems to encourage them as behaviours that will ""help her get ahead in life"" (in my view he is a maladapted person going through a perpetual midlife crisis but that's an issue for another post).

72,"So I am 33 weeks pregnant now and DH and I are planning on setting up a *safe* cosleeping arrangement as well as a pack n play setup for baby to use as a crib. We've had our eyes set on the Graco Cuddle Cove Pack N Play.

Things we like about it:

- vibration unit that goes under the bassinet section of mat to lull baby to sleep
- attached changing table and organization area for creams, wipes, diapers, etc.
- removable rocking and vibrating newborn napper that I can move baby around in while he naps

Well, our friends gave us a pack n play play yard by itself that they got from a relative. And it's so kind of them! But it doesn't even have a bassinet that goes with it. I tried looking for replacement parts, but they don't have even a bassinet that is made to go with it. Our friends have a pack n play with a bassinet and we tried to fit their bassinet with this pack n play. It fit well, but two of the bars didn't have a place to stick the ends like on their own, and my friend said, ""well, you could just jury rig it!"" That makes me nervous, honestly, it being something my child may be sleeping in to ""just jury rig it"" for the support bars. I am worried that if it's not sold with a bassinet, maybe you can't get a different one from a different model.

82,"This is loooong, on mobile, and I’m emotionally depleted so please bear with me.

So just over a week ago, I started the Oh Crap! Method with my daughter who will be two on the 29th. She was naked the first and second day, and did great. She went pee on the potty within our first few hours of training and continued to have success throughout the day. The following day followed suit and she would actually back up to sit in her little potty (we kept it in our living room), and took a poop unprompted. I was ecstatic! We were still having lots of accidents by day 3, but the accident to successful potty trips was at a 50/50 ratio. Her accidents typically occurred if she was super immersed in playing (particularly outside), or if it was close to nap/bedtime and she was tired. 

We had to leave the house on day four, so I put her in underwear with a pull-up over it because I just wasn’t down with her peeing in her car seat.  I know that’s against the Oh Crap! Method but the commando thing in the car seat/shopping cart was a part I chose to modify. We went to Costco and I took her to the restroom there and she got a big kick out of it, but didn’t go. When we got home her underwear/pull-up was dry and she successfully peed on her little potty. I felt encouraged enough by that, and it eased my fear that a pull-up would totally ruin our progress. 

By day 7, we were always wearing pull-ups on outings (naked at home), and having mixed success. She was in a pull-up for an extended period of time that day due to a dentist appointment and a play-date and ended up pooping in the pull-up in addition to pee. Now we are at a point where she is irritated with her little potty, and will only sit on it if she can watch TV or be read a book. And she rarely actually eliminates. She’s starting to hold her pee/poo until she starts to have an accident and we have to whisk her off to potty. She pees/poops in the backyard as freely as our dogs even though we bring her potty outside. She just seems totally over it.

We did a reset as of yesterday and she has been butt naked, at home, all weekend except for nap/bedtime. Unfortunately, the progress seems to be going on reverse quite a bit. 

Here is what’s still working:

-she is aware enough to at lease say, “I went poop” (she says that for pee and poop) either right before she has an accident or during. She’s consistent with this about 75% of the time.

-She is very verbal so she can at least tell us a bit about what’s going on and seems to get basic concepts.

-rewards, kind of. When we did the reset she was given one gummy bear every time she did a pee or poo in potty, even if it was a partial due to starting as an accident. She loves getting a gummy bear, and will sometimes briefly sit on potty and say, “yay, I get a yummy gummy!” But then we explain to her that she has to actually make a pee/poo to get one. 

What’s not working:

-the pull-up thing. I got a piddle pad for her car seat but the first time we used it her urine soaked through the buckle hole and I had to wash car seat. I’m going to try a puppy pad under the piddle pad for extra protection but I’m pretty nervous about having leaks in the car seat again. It’s a bitch to clean and re-install. Oh did I mention I’m seven months pregnant and that thing is a beast to lift?

-being housebound. Her and I get stir crazy if inside too long. But I’m also terrified of a poop on the library/store/children’s museum floor. We had two successful outings last week to storytime/park. One was accident free, the other she peed in her pull-up.  

-she is apprehensive of big toilets or public toilets, and often will flat out refuse to even sit on them. Hence why I’ve been relying a bit on pull-ups. We’ve only had success with the little potty, and she will say, “no I want to use my little potty!”


I feel kind of lost at this point. We’re going out of town next weekend for her second birthday and I don’t want to stress her out on her special day with over-prompting/accident stress/etc. especially when everything is still so shakey and inconsistent. 

If you made it through this novella, any and all sympathy or advice is appreciated!",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
84,"Very weird title I know, but I didn't know how to condense what I was asking LOL

I am STM currently 34w1d with Di/Di girls and the past few nights I have been having contractions, not Braxton Hicks but actual contractions.

Tuesday I thought I was just sleeping funny and had to pee and I was just uncomfortable. 

Wednesday night it woke me out of my sleep multiple times to the point I got worried and actually started timing them. To which they were 8-10 mins apart for 4 hours straight, until they just dwindled away and I fell back asleep.  

Last night I actually slept, and had minimal inconsistent contractions so I didn't really worry since these are the typical ones I feel on a daily basis. 

I had an OB appointment today so I knew just to make sure I mention it to her since I've had an extremely good and complication free pregnancy. 
She decided to measure me and I was 3cm and 50/60% effaced and basically has told me to be on bed rest in hopes to keep them in a little longer as my hospital has a protocol that any baby born before 35 weeks gets sent to a larger hospital 1 hour away for monitoring and tests. 

My question is; has anyone been in similar situations of contractions and delivery shortly after? If so what was your experience? 

I'm doing my best to relax, and have good help around me but sometimes it sounds nice to hear other experiences.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

86,"We are in the midst of what I am starting to think is the 4 mo sleep regression and I could really do with some hope/inspiration.

Searching on the other subs leads to lots of “it only got better once we sleep trained” so that’s depressing  af and we obviously won’t be doing that.

I’m doing everything I can to just ensure we all get as much rest as possible- cosleeping sometimes (not great as baby kicks and scratches me while feeding so I don’t get much rest), laying down to feed during the day, eating well and getting enough water, my spouse is supportive and does their bit etc.

I’m not expecting my baby to suddenly start sleeping 12 hours straight, and I know that it will obviously get better eventually (it’s not like it’s going to last till he’s 18...) but I need to know that there’s more than 60-90 minute stretches of sleep on the horizon, not in 3 years time.

89,"We're two weeks into round two of potty training (failed at 19mo).  It's going well, we've had so much success.

DH was playing with our 26mo when she got up and said she had to potty.  He got her over there, but not before she had an accident.  In trying to get her pants down, he made a huge mess, and I think she felt shamed/embarrassed and is now really against being on the potty.  She's also got some diarrhea since the incident, which is irritating the region, which is making clean up a struggle.  I've smeared some paste on her for the evening, and I plan on doing a pull up change when I go to bed to make sure that she's clean and dry for the entire night.
