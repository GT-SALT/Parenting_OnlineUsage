3,"## 1. Allow them some ""alone"" time

The most important thing for a parent with a very sensitive child is to understand them and accept them as they are. A HSC needs their own space and time to recharge themselves. This can be as important as breathing.

### 2. Show some Empathy

 A common question many parents ask is: how to help a very sensitive child? All you need is to understand and be sympathetic to them. It is important to understand that having HSC at home might mean more stares, more emotional flare ups, more pain, and more emotionally intense experiences.  It is normal for the parents of such a child to feel upset from time to time and lose their patience but you need to work on acceptance.

### 3. Approval

 Never apologize to people for the child’s emotions and sensitivity. They are born with it and every time they apologize to people for being how they are, they may feel that their emotions, sympathy, sensitivity, or the way they behave is somehow wrong. This can lower his self-esteem.

### 4. Gradually help them face their fears

 Help them do things that they are afraid of or dread in a slow and gradual manner.  This may help them overcome certain aversions. However, this should be done at a gradual pace and not in a hurry.For example, a child may refrain from wearing a cardigan because she feels itchy in it.   You might ask her to wear it for a short time to get used to it and then praise her. If the sensation begins to go away, it may be worth keeping up.   Children may find it helpful to face some aversive stimuli when it’s not harmful to their well-being, but this should not be framed or used as a punishment.

### 5. Keeping a Pet

 HSC love animals, so use their preference and make the house better by having a pet for them.   Having a pet at home will calm them down, and they will also have a companion to play with. You may want to watch out for allergies but beyond that, a pet is a great idea.

### 6. Do not use common methods of discipline for HSC

 Using common serious methods of punishment such as yelling, and others will only make matters worse for a highly sensitive child. They can respond to this by screaming, crying, and throwing angry tantrums.   Therefore, disciplining highly sensitive children should be done differently. You should talk to them and emphasize aspects like consequences and well-being, helping them better understand themselves.

### 7. Talk to your child when upset

 When you see your child crying, ask them why.  Talk to them when they are upset and validate their feelings even when you feel that the reason was minor.   Engaging in dialogue and respecting the child’s feelings is especially important with a HSC.

### 8. Help them stand against the bullies

 Highly sensitive children might cry or be different from their peers, so they have a higher risk of being bullied by other children at school. In such a situation, first of all, teach your child not to be afraid.   If such a situation arises, tell them that they should put a brave face in front of the bullies and tell the teacher about it. As a parent, you should also go and talk to the teacher and the school authorities.

### 9. Do not try to change them

 Highly sensitive children cannot help that they feel the way they do. They are born this way.   Thus, a parent should accept this and not try to change it. Attempting to change this sensitivity would only prove detrimental to the child’s overall development.

### 10. Accept your HSC and appreciate them 

 A very sensitive child is endowed with many good qualities that you can b e proud of.   You will realize that they are more caring, kind, and sympathetic to people and animals than many children their age. They are very sociable and can read a person well.   They are usually very creative and may become great writers / storytellers, actors and artists. Therefore, accept them and appreciate them for the person they are.  the whole article====&gt; [https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html](https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html?fbclid=IwAR3-EWcs2USCXHU-_xp0Ua3B8SckwCCSfD17o0tfpsQxvRrGx69SfTGiWbw)",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
7,"((Also posted in r/pregnancy so I can get different perspectives.))

I was told by my lactation consultant that baby has tongue tie and we should get it corrected. I found a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and performing the laser treatment to correct it.

However - if baby is primarily formula fed now (my milk production is too low to fully feed on breast but she still gets her breastmilk snack every feeding session) is it worth putting the baby through the procedure?

Researching online - the primary objective of this surgery is to help the baby latch and improve breastfeeding. If that is all the correction is for, I don’t want to put my baby through a procedure she doesn’t need...what do I do?

Edit/Note: Correcting tongue tie could hopefully stimulate milk production, however I’m currently on antibiotics so I’m unable to breastfeed for another week (pump and dumping). One breast does not produce milk at all. This happened after the last round of antibiotics. Therefore I don’t think the tongue tie is the sole reason for lack of milk production and correcting it may not bring my milk back.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

9,"**Education regarding breastfeeding should begin once a mother is**[ **pregnant**](https://pregnancycentr.com/7-weeks-pregnant-belly/)**. The biggest worry a brand new mother usually verbalizes is ‘do you think that I actually have enough milk?’ once they square measure troubled and feeling they’re not activity enough for his or her baby, is much too late. It is a small amount like ‘shutting the gate once the horse has barred.** 

 

**Why not teach them before the birth about the ways to stop this happening, to have a chance of success?**

**Often it is the new mother’s lifestyle that is the contributing factor as they have been caught up in the euphoria of the birth and a multitude of visitors! They are so busy pleasing the visitors by chatting, making tea, and showing off their newborn baby, they become exhausted. So many new mums are on a ‘high’ after the birth and try to carry on as normal. It is a few days /weeks later when they are having problems, that they realize they did too much too soon.**

## Breastfeeding mothers

**The key to establishing a good milk supply in the early days is rest. The mother’s body needs time to recover from the birth and to be able to make milk. Often it is put on overload! All the responsibilities in the house should be offloaded to another family member.**  **Expectations regarding standards may have to be lowered during this time! This will enable them to relax and reduce their stress level. Have set rest times so that if friends and relatives want to visit, these periods can then be avoided. It also gives the new mother and father the assurance of knowing there is space in the day for them. I have seen new parents weeping with tiredness because the doorbell has gone non-stop and they have been making endless cups of tea. Remember the telephone and front door need to be controlled in the day to cope with the night shift as well!** 

 

### how to increase breast milk?

**All breastfeeding mothers need to watch their fluid intake very carefully. This has a strong influence on making plenty of milk. They need to replace what they are giving out to the baby and drink enough for their own hydration and to make more milk. This is where a lot of mothers go wrong. My advice is to always have a drink beside them before they breastfeed and drink it by the time they have finished feeding. Water, unsweetened fruit juices or milk are preferable Very often when I have questioned a mother who is struggling with her milk supply, this is a key factor. She has just drunk her usual 3** [**cups of tea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Cups_of_Tea)**! Eating and drinking well are very important to produce good milk. It has been suggested that drinking certain herbal teas such as fennel, increases lactation, but the effectiveness of this has not yet been proved.**",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
15,"- inverted nipples, baby would not latch. I really wanted to breastfeed. The first night in the hospital I was crying all night - not from pain from the c section, not from pain to my nipples, but because we just could not make breastfeeding work.

- the next morning, I was offered a shield by the day nurse. I was in love - it enabled us to feed. He latched immediately, was sucking immediately. However, I was told I had to pump after every feed to ensure I was emptying my breasts. 

- baby lost a little too much weight in first week (went from 3400g to 3005 in 5 days, then back up to 3420 by day 17 of life). During this time we were followed by a lactation consultant as well. While we did make the long term goal of getting off the nipple shield, it wasn't in the cards right now. Without needing to supplement, baby reached birth weight juuuuust over two weeks. Doctor was okay with this weight loss and then gain considering the emergency section.

- when we reached birth weight, we were then advised by LC to wean off of pumping. She recommended cutting out night pumping entirely, pumping every other daytime feed for a week. Then to titrate down to once a day (she recommended mixing up the time of day I pumped). 

Birth: 3400g
5 days: 3005g
1 week: 3140g
2 weeks: 3420g
4 weeks: 3855g
5 weeks: 4125g

Today, 5 weeks 4 days, my dog destroyed my pump parts. I was dumb. I had left them on the coffee table for like 5-10 minutes. The bottle neck is likely still usable, but the connecting piece/lid piece that goes on the bottle and connects to the actual pump is destroyed. The neck is crushed, the part that connects to the breast shield is crushed. I had a good cry. Yelled at my dog (fruitlessly, she doesn't understand, but I was frustrated and upset and yelled anyways), then went on amazon and ordered replacement parts. Unfortunately, with the holiday weekend this weekend (Canada, eh?), amazon estimates delivery Sept 7th. 

So my question being, will my supply suffer terribly if I can't pump for a week? I'm stressing out a little bit - I was on domperidone because of my 'slow start' but after my month prescription ended, my doctor took me off. She felt I didn't need it anymore.

30,"After being a little in denial about it for a few weeks (supply while pumping dropped, little guy happily drinking a bottle of formula after nursing), I've realized that my supply is just not quite there. I'm also tired of dealing with the screaming before nursing and am looking forward to having some independence from the little guy. So at a little over 10 months into it, I'm going to cut out a pumping session at work. And then another. And then the third. And then we'll see how it goes. 

I've been reading the old posts on weaning and am so grateful for the advice and reassurance in those posts/from the community.

And as awful as it was at moments (thrush, biting, cluster feeding, distracted feeding), it's been amazing to provide him with the nutrition this whole time. 

I guess my question is that after I cut out the pumping during the day - which feeding do I drop? I'm guessing the morning one since he doesn't seem that interested in it, and then the night one is the last to go? Is it okay to start offering a bottle after nursing before bed too?

6.30 - 7pm nurse to sleep or until drowsy. If not asleep she's put in her cot to fall asleep with pink bunny. Maybe some bum patting.

8-9pm up for a quick feed maybe a burp, maybe just a cuddle. Straight back to sleep.

55,"As we continue our journey using CBD, we continue see my daughter reaching her full potential.  We would love to share the benefits we have seen by using CBD.
We have recently switched oils to one that is CBD/CBG. It is an oil that has the highest amounts of CBG.  What is CBG? Cannabigerol is the pre-curser or mother phytocannabinoid.  It has a direct effect on the Enndocannabinoid System and cannabinoid receptors. CBG is very exciting because it helps with some many things that are beneficial for DS. A major finding with CBG is it's neuroprotective and neurodegenerative traits.  Also, it a very valuable resource for gut health, as it's phytonutrients directly attack infectious bacteria.  It's other values are supports bone health, improves mood, and promotes natural analgesic (discomfort relief).

One of my major concerns is the fact of so many children with DS develop early onset of dementia and Alzheimer's.  There are many studies that have been done or are being done on how CBD slows or can possibly prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.  So knowing this is a major reason I will continue to give this to my daughter. 
Update on Ari
Behavior: CBD/CBG have defiantly helped with behavior. It has gotten her out of the fight/flight mode.  A balanced enndocannabinoid system will bring anyone out of the constant fight/flight mode.  And we definatly see that with Ari. The crazy melt downs in a store or where ever, are very far and few between.  It's not to say she never has an episode just like NT children, but we don't need to walk on egg shells wondering if we should bring her places. 
We have continued to notice her increased focus.  This just adds to every aspect.  Being able to sit longer, be engaged in an activity longer.  With this she is then able to learn more and apply what she is learning.
Speech Therapy: We have seen great results in her speech. From going from trying to decipher her language to being able to have clear communication is happy dance in its self.  She is reaching goals in speech therapy faster.  So lessons are moving quickly.
Physical Therapy: I'm excited about her gains.  We use to set new goals about every 2-3 months.  Now we set monthly goals. This goes hand in hand with her focus.  Being able to focus and understand, her strength and abilities are coming at a faster rate.  It's so nice to leave every Therapy with a therapist amazed she doesn't fit into their limited beliefs. OT basically has the same results

I do believe that age does play a small part in her success, but the 2 together is definitely a great combo.

84,"Corbin James' VBAC Birth story


This is an update to the post I made when I was 14 weeks along: [Feeling Discouraged About VBAC but Can't Bring Myself to Choose Repeat C](https://www.reddit.com/r/vbac/comments/5c4uaz/feeling_discouraged_about_vbac_but_cant_bring/) 
I'll preface this by saying that even though my VBAC had interventions and complications, I am so relieved and happy that I didn't have to go through major surgery again. 

Earlier on, I was worried that the OB I'd been seeing didn't want me to go past 40 or maybe 41 weeks. I ended up seeing 2 other doctors in the same OB practice later in my 2nd and 3rd tri who were much more encouraging and optimistic about attempting a VBAC. I tried to request these specific providers for most of my remaining appointments and just hoped they'd be on call if I went into labor on my own. This baby seemed to be measuring at least a pound smaller than my first baby (who ended up being 9lb 5oz) which was very reassuring. Still, I kept telling myself I probably wouldn't go into labor and tried to mentally prepare myself for another c-section...

...Which brings us to Thursday, May 11 (I was 40w+2d). I took my 3yo to his gymnastics class and sat in the waiting room clucking with the other hens. While I was there I felt what seemed like strong BH contractions but shrugged them off, convinced that was all they were. Throughout the rest of the day they were definitely uncomfortable but I was still in denial until late afternoon/early evening. I turned the TV on for my son and started packing, organizing &amp; getting cleaned up just in case something was happening. At some point, I went to the bathroom &amp; out came some of the mucus plug, with the rest to follow a few hours later. By the time my husband got home from work I was pretty sure I was in labor, so we called my MIL to come &amp; get big boy. 

I bounced and swayed on the exercise ball while timing the contractions on the Full Term app. They seemed to start really picking up around 8 or 9pm, and they were close together but still irregular (about 35-45sec long and 2.5-3min apart most of the time.) In between contractions I chatted with my husband and we went over last minute plans &amp; instructions. I was in such disbelief that I had actually gone into labor on my own. 

After a while the ball became too painful so I put a towel on the floor and gripped the end of the bed while swaying back &amp; forth on my knees for each contraction. They stayed confusing and irregular, but when they started becoming super painful I just knew it was go time. My husband loaded the car &amp; we left sometime after 11 for the hospital. It's about 15min away so I had a few contractions in the car, and had to yell a little during them but was still excited and in good spirits in between.  

We got checked in &amp; a nurse wheeled me up to my L&amp;D room. The ward was empty except for us and the nurse did not look thrilled to see me. Contractions were coming about 2 minutes apart at this point. I went to the bathroom and as I was attempting to collect a urine sample, I felt a gush &amp; saw some blood, but wasn't really sure if my water had broken. I got into the bed &amp; felt a couple small gushes so the nurse took a quick peek &amp; said she didn't think so. She then proceeded to tell me this baby was probably going to be as big or bigger than my first. (WTF lady?!) I turned my head to exchange an incredulous eye roll with my husband, rather than punching her in the face. 

Apparently I was dilated to about a 3 so they hung a bag of fluids and said I could have pain relief once it was empty. This took FOREVER!! I focused on the center of a fan in the ceiling and breathed through the contractions for...I don't know...about an hour but it felt like a long ass time! They became excruciatingly painful, almost scary painful at times. My husband reminded me to breathe and told me I was doing great. 

At some point, the doctor showed up (one of my 2 favorite ones!) and I was happy to see her. She determined I was still at a 3 and there was a little bit of meconium in my waters. The anesthesiologist placed my epidural shortly thereafter. It got a little scary because my blood pressure bottomed out 3 times and I had to get the ephedrine shot each time to bring me back. After that drama, I labored another few hours contracting perfectly on my own but without much progress, which started to worry me. The doctor suggested a tiny bit of Pitocin to help me along, which was surprising and I normally would not have agreed to it but I actually trust this doctor. She reassured me that at such a small dose the risk was minimal. 

My husband and I slept for a while and in the morning who should appear but my OTHER favorite OB! She was still on board with the VBAC and upped my Pitocin just a little. For the next several hours, it was a lot of back &amp; forth with the RN checking me &amp; being very pessimistic, then the OB checking after her &amp; saying I was actually 1-2cm further than the RN had said. Once I got to about an 8 according to the nurse, my OB came in and said she could probably stretch it. So she did, and I started pushing. I'm pretty sure they had turned the epidural down some time ago because I had pain at the top of my belly and also at my right hip, making it harder for me to curl up while pushing. The nurse held my right leg while my husband held the left. I probably did about 15 pushes before the OB said his head was right there but he wasn't coming out. She suggested using the forceps, and I didn't know much about them but there wasn't much time for that so I said okay. It was really strange watching her twist &amp; pull on my baby's head with these things and I tried not to think gruesome thoughts. I heard her request scissors &amp; then a quick ""snip"" sound...Oh yay, an episiotomy. 

But then he was out! And he had so much hair! And they put him right on me! I said my hellos and told him how warm and slimy he was, and then watched as my husband cut the cord right there on my belly! 

Corbin James G. weighed 8lb 4oz and measured 20""long. The OB said the reason he couldn't come out was because his hand was up by his face (just like it was in all of his ultrasounds.) I got to hold him and nurse him there for a long time and was so relieved that we didn't have to be separated. Even after Pitocin, forceps, episiotomy, and a 2nd degree tear I'm still happy to have avoided the c-section experience we went through with our first. Recovery has been tough but not nearly as bad as the first time around, and I've been able to manage the pain with just ibuprofen. Corbin is nursing pretty well and had mostly gained his birth weight back at his 2 week appointment yesterday. He's adorable and we're so happy and proud of both of our boys!

He went from basically denying we were close friends ( I mean so close we spend almost every weekend together, like my son and I at his place, of course me sleeping with my son, to beach trips , etc) to plain out loud telling her how good she looks. He would often say how impress she was by almost any coment, asking her for dreams for the future etc.

I hate to sound like a negative person but your dreams when you are so fresh out of college are so big, and often you realize that life has limitations and you wont turn out to be married to prince William.

He then turned to me, and asked her why do I always complaint about my job, that im such a negative person. I explained I have a whole lot more reponsabilities than her, and my boss (who is the owner) relies on me even when it comes to hire people at the factorie. I also have a child, and that will make anyone more more hours, even outside work line. The girl back me up saying my job is not nearly as stressful as hers , but then he said maybe I shouldn’t cook so much for my son and get him use to pbj sandwiches and man up.

I saw her, she is in her 20´s and Im in my mids 30. I know I cant ever compete with younger people specially those who invest 3 hours a day in gym , yoga and surfing. I get she has dreams and ambition, and I wish all her dreams come true, and I had those dreams that were limited when I decided to raise a child. Limited because I cant work as much as I would because I have things at home, and I am sorry im not so happy go lucky with things because reality is diferent for me.

But I was hurt by my friend choosing to question my opinions. I was hurt that I was blindisided that he was trying to do something goo and maybe noble and all he wanted was meeting her and get a number. I was crushed that my friend, the man I admired was making me seem so small, instead of cheering me up when he knows perfectly well how this path is so often difficult and challenging.

That maybe im not a heroe, but I am trying my hardest to raise a child I didn’t create on my own and I was lied into motherhood wich a total different plan. I had to quit my dream jon, the one I was CEO for Latin America SALES, so I could have more time with my son, so no im not stupid or not educated,.

And now I am really wonder if being a single mom, chosing limitations as economics etc make you damage goods. Make you complicated .

123,"First off, sorry if this comes across disjointed or I ramble, I’m trying to get it all off my chest and I’m just typing whatever comes to mind. 

My partner and I have been together 11years and have three children 9,6 and 2. Our relationship has always been very strong and loving, we’ve had our ups and downs and we’ve treated each other like shit at times but we’ve always worked through our problems and come out the other side stronger and more grateful for what we have.  I honestly cannot ever imagine my life without him but this seems to be a recurring argument that we just cannot seem to settle on. We will argue about it, cool off and go back to how things were before but I’m getting close to breaking point now and I’m not sure if it’s me being unreasonable or if I am actually right in feeling so fed up. 

We got together long distance and after seeing each other only at weekends for a year I moved to his area and we rented a house together. I had been offered a place to start university to become a teacher and was actively looking for jobs when I found out I was pregnant with our first child. Nobody wanted to hire me being pregnant and I decided the best thing to do was defer my uni place for a year and start when our baby was 6months old (his mum looked after our child whilst I was in lectures etc). We followed the plan and I graduated 3years later whilst ready to pop with our second child. This has meant that from the very beginning my partner has provided for me on his own. And now 11years and three kids later he still does. There has never been an opportunity for me to work, even part time. Childcare is horrendously expensive and it makes no sense to either of us for me to put our youngest in childcare just so that all my work pay would go on paying for said childcare. I completely understand how lucky I am to have been able to bring up all of our children and be home to witness every milestone and school achievement while my OH has had to miss a lot through working. 

He wakes up at 5am mon-Friday, leaves at 6am and drives an hour to work where he does manual labour for 10/12 hours a day only to do the hour drive home and see kids for just an hour or so before their bedtime or sometimes not at all. I am so so grateful for all of his hard work and I tell him all the time how much he is appreciated and loved. I’ve even offered to work weekends so that I can bring in a little extra money as I feel so guilty that I cannot contribute financially. We do struggle on one income and he gets extremely worried how we will get through some months, but he won’t entertain the idea of me working weekends and says that the weekends are for us to spend together which I totally get and I feel very lucky for him to pick family time over money. It’s important to add that he is self employed so his pay can vary drastically from month to month. He doesn’t get any paid holiday or sick time and so every day off (especially the two weeks of Xmas) means he is loosing out on money that he will not get back. Of course this all adds to his stress. 

So anyway on to my issue. As a SAHM I expect and am totally happy to look after the kids and keep the household going. I do all the breakfasts and get the kids ready for school then spend the day with our youngest whilst tidying, sorting life admin and running errands, then once the two eldest are back from school I do any homework/reading/spellings they have to do, cook dinner every night and tidy the house again either just before they go to bed or after. I basically never stop. My head is a jumble of school activities and other appointments I need to remember, making sure the kids are always fed, clean and happy, keeping the house tidy and on top of that dealing with my narcissistic mother which I am currently on a waiting list to see a therapist for as she has/does cause me an immeasurable amount of stress. I have no down time apart from a few hours in the evening and even then I still have to shower and look after myself which if I’m being honest is the last thing I want to do.

As soon as my OH is home his tea is either nearly ready for him (once he has showered) or is on the table waiting for him. He doesn’t and hasn’t ever cooked in all the years we’ve been together (apart from the odd omelette and beans for the kids once in a blue moon or oven food which even then I have to either instruct him how to do it or intervene eventually), he doesn’t ever use his initiative to tidy up or help around the house but every so often (maybe every couple of months) will go on mad cleaning sprees where he tuts and huffs because the place is such a mess (it’s usually if I’ve been out all day or just not had the energy to do everything on my ever growing list). He has never done homework or spellings or reading with the kids (he only found out last week that our youngest has had a reading diary for the last two years that I have to fill out and leave comments in daily otherwise the school will bollock me/not change my youngest’s reading book). He never puts his dirty clothes in the washing basket, just leaves them lying about and I’m
pretty sure he has no clue how to use the washing machine. He doesn’t clear his plate away after eating (putting leftover food in the bin then putting plate in the sink to be washed) even though the kids know to do it, even our youngest at the age of 2 does it.

The latest thing, which has tipped me over the edge recently is him having a go at me for not cleaning out the car regularly enough. I’m not just talking about getting all the coats, socks, toys, drinks bottles etc out of it, which I do already, but a whole fucking valet! He wants it hoovered and polished too. We brought the car (a sporty hatchback, his choice) a few months ago after having a very old, rundown and unreliable car for the last couple of years. I get that he is proud of it and wants to keep it tidy but if he thought a family of five sharing a smallish car wasn’t going to end up with muddy footprints and crumbs all over it then he should’ve brought something older and bigger. Yes we both drive it but it was his choice of car, his baby (god that sounds so cringy sorry!) so I don’t see why he can’t make the effort once a week or whenever he sees fit to clean it himself. When does he want me to do this car cleaning exactly, in the middle of the night when I’ve finally got everything else done?! 

Guys I’m so sorry for the rant but I just wanted to get it all down so you can read all the evidence. I know I’ve probably made him out to sound like a horrible person but he is such a great dad and partner in every other way and he always puts us first before himself. Our relationship is great apart this issue and that’s why I struggle to hold my own and stick to my guns when an argument about this arises. 

His argument is that he works 12hr days, has all the stress of having to pay for us all and find the money for everything and” if it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t have a house that needs cleaning or any food to make dinner with in the first place”. Every time we argue he ends up just making me feel like I’m being a spoilt brat and majorly ungrateful and I end up just feeling like my feelings are inferior to his. And as I said before, we cool off and things pick up as normal which only adds to me feeling like maybe I’m being too harsh on him. 

It’s only ever us, my family lives hours away and I have major trouble with them. And his parents/family live 45mins away but never come to visit, ring to ask how the kids are or offer to help out it’s always one sided with us doing all the visiting etc so the kids don’t miss out completely but we never get time for ourselves separately or together which of course only adds to both of our stresses. We’ve not had a date night in over 3years. 

Am I being unreasonable here? Or do I have a solid argument about the way things are? I have no idea how to fix this without an argument that leads to no change, only resentment. I do not want to and would not tear my family apart over this but sometimes I just feel like running away. I don’t want to be the house cook and cleaner for the rest of my life.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

158,"Hello /r/adoption. I am seeking advice on how to reach out to my first-father’s widow (who I will call “A’”). I am a late-discovery adoptee who learned I was adopted at 18. Late last year, I found my first-father’s obituary. He passed away seven years ago, the same year I learned I was adopted. 

In March, my mom helped me find the life-partner who was listed in his obituary. My mom and A talked a little back and forth, and my mom passed along my email address. A was so sweet and thoughtful and seemed enthusiastic. She said she would be in touch and would compile some photos of my dad for me. She even said that she had some of my dad’s things & his ashes and would happy to send them to me. (I don’t think it's my place to accept them?, but it meant so much that she offered.)

It’s been six months now, and I have not heard from her. 

I have A’s email address, and would like to reach out to her. It’s complicated though - I’m not actually related in any way to this person, by blood or by law, so she has even less reasons to want to help me than a relative would. It also appears that she did not know about me (she told my mom, “He’d be beyond stoked to know he had a daughter! That’s crazy fantastic to hear!”), and when my mom spoke with her, Mom didn’t explain that my dad did know about me. (I’m told he actually raised me and played with me and loved me for a year before his parental rights were terminated.)

I want to tread very lightly and gently - I know this person owes me nothing, and I don’t want to awaken any feelings of grief. I can’t imagine how much it must hurt to lose your life partner, and then have that person’s daughter come looking for you for answers almost a decade later. I don’t know if it would hurt her to know that my dad did know about me, and didn’t tell her. (Please note that I don’t judge my dad for not telling her - maybe he buried the grief, etc.)

Does anyone here have any advise on what to say? Should I write a longer message, explaining who I am and telling her a little about myself and a short list of questions? Should I write a very brief message, just checking in? She isn’t related to me and has no reason to help me. But she is the only person I am aware of who knew my dad, and probably the closest to him. I feel terrible for intruding on her life, and want to tread lightly.

161,"Hello Gents, 

Tl;Dr: How can I help my wife stay motivated to keep working out like she wants to while morning sickness is keeping her down?

Something like 6 weeks along and morning sickness is kicking in pretty hard on her. She stayed home two days in the last two weeks because it was so bad. She's exhausted, I mean rightly so seeing as how she's growing a human, and doesn't want to work out but keeps stressing how she's bloated, gaining weight, and only wants to snack. 

I tried giving her workout tips in the moths leading up to us getting pregnant but she never took up any of them and now she's adding on some weight (plus bloating so that only makes it seem worse). I read thought that first time mom's tend to gain more than those on their second or beyond. 

Through AL this I've got to admit, I'm worn down from all her complaining. She's remaining adamant that she's not going to gain more than 25lbs... I can't workout for her and I've exhausted all the, ""let's go together,"" ""I'll make a plan for you,"" and etc. routes.  I honestly don't care how much she does or doesn't gain as long as they both stay healthy.

165,"Hello again all,

Myself (29M) and my partner (32F) are now 13 weeks 5 days pregnant from the time this was posted. For information purposes we are both in Las Vegas NV and I work for a well known casino here. Also I apologize for this whole post jumping around and being random. I'm stressed. 

Now that we are in the second trimester my partner is finally mostly past her morning sickness and feeling like crap and basically looking like she might die, which is a good thing! She still gets slight nausea, but is able to keep food down a lot more and is a LOT more active which is awesome. During her time near the end of her first trimester I had two jobs lined up for her which she didn't feel well enough to do either (One working Front Desk, the other working in a Call Center, both for the same company I work for just different departments) so she never called back either manager.

Now that she's feeling better we are talking more and preparing more for our child, today after lunch my mother gave us some money because she wanted to pay for our Car Seat for the baby, so we went to Babies R Us since it's closing however we both noticed how expensive things were. Nice car seats were 120-300, Stroller combos were almost 400, cribs were 200-500, clothing, bottles, formula, all of this insanely expensive. I think it was a very large awakening for both of us and panic set in.

I'm the only one working in our household, we pay 969 a month rent, and basically after all bills we have 700$ left over. This is NOT including food for us, or anything for the baby yet. So obviously I'm worried... Especially once our child arrives I'll still be the only one working because I KNOW she will want to stay home with the baby, and she doesn't want me to work two jobs due to not seeing me and helping but... It's also not the 1950s anymore... Shit is far harder as I'm sure a lot of you know. I only make 16.70 an hour so I'm kinda freaking out, just right now she said she thinks she should start working but if she has an on call job wouldn't we lose our Medicaid? Also now that she says she thinks she should work she doesn't want to work for any of the guaranteed jobs I had lined up for her but wants to find work at something more ""ethical"" or that ""serves a higher purpose"" yet as far as I know there isn't ANYTHING like that in Vegas... So... Wtf?

Also we have NO idea what brands for baby stuff are to be trusted, I've tried looking and reading into stuff however there are SO many different opinions it all seems to contradict one another... I have no idea what the best car seat is, stroller, backpack... Thing? (diaper bag) or diapers, food, pacifiers, nothing, I feel so unprepared for this child and scared yet I try to put a brave face on for my partner because she's TERRIFIED that stuff isn't going to work out or that we will live in poverty... So I'm lost as hell.

The only people who know are very close family on my side and only her mother on hers... When I talk to her about telling people on hers she just says ""when the time is right"" but wouldn't you want to tell people sooner than later in order for them to be hyped up more or want to help more? Or... Idk. We are definitely going to have to have two separate baby showers just because all her side is in Washington and mine is down here and I don't even know where to begin with that or when to do it.

So, at the suggestion of some others here I picked up Oh Crap, we're on block 2.
Day 1, she peed in little drips on the potty and then mostly in her nap and night diapers. Day 2 she was a lot more eager to sit, sat a bunch but held her pee and towards the end of the day finally had a great big pee in the potty.

Because she had peed in the potty two days in a row and wasnt peeing on the floor (this whole time she only has once) I decided to move on to block 2 at day 4, yesterday. She woke up in a bad mood yesterday and refused any liquids all morning, did not pee in her nap diaper, finally took liquids in the afternoon and evening and still no pee in the potty.

Is this just resistance? Did I transition to pants too soon?

My wife and I have a 7 week old son. He has been formula fed since the very beginning but we keep having issues. And we do have his two month appointment coming up so we will be discussing with our doctor but we are puzzled. Looking to see if anyone has had any similiar experiences. 

We started him on the Similac Pro-Advance. He had A LOT of trouble with gas. Constantly fussy because of it. He seemed miserable. We switched to Pro-Total Comfort. This helped with the gas some but his stools started becoming almost solid. I mean chunkier and harder than peanut butter. It was almost the consistency of clay. Once again, miserable. We called the doctor and she recommended 2-4oz. of prune juice. This worked fairly well. We figured it must be a formula issue so for the last 11 days, we have been using Gerber SoothePro. He is NEVER gassy on this one but the poop issue continues. He will turn red, push, strain, cry, etc. We have used prune juice, stomach massages, rowing his legs, and more! We eventually get him to poop but the consistency is still almost clay like and it takes hours to get him to poop. He hasn't pooped without some sort of assistance in a few weeks. I understand he's still learning how to work everything and where to push but the consistency is concerning. There has to be a solution!

Quick Recap
Pro-Advance: Miserably gassy
Pro-Total Comfort: Less gassy, clay like poop
SoothePro: No gas issues, still clay like poop

It has to be a formula issue, right? I don't want to jump the gun and think digestion issues. We use Dr. Brown bottles if anyone believes that makes a difference. 

Any and all help is appreciated! Thank you in advance!",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False
210,"Hey everyone!

So a thought crossed my mind today. I am having a kid in July (our first) and we are pretty sure we are going to stop at one.

Reasons for this are varied, finances being one of them and 2nd biggest of all, hoping its going to be easier on us. Happier, less stressed parents with more free time may equal more energy and happiness for the kid, etc. (That's just personally how we think- others may be energized by or love a big family and that's great! But we are both pretty introverted and thrive on quiet and down time)

I'm nervous about the impending difficulties of parenthood, I will be honest. Many parents talk about how exhausting the work is, if it isn't a screaming newborn, a toddler into everything, diapers, bathtime, bedtime, soccer practice, screen time, homework, friends, are they drinking or smoking? Etc. 

I'm hoping to get some anecdotal evidence from you all because I don't really have a frame of reference (most people I've asked have 2, 3, 4 kids and talk about how difficult and exhausting it can be most days). How much easier is it to raise an only child? I'd imagine that raising 2, 3, 4+ would be, well, 2, 3, 4+ times as difficult overall because there are multiple bedtimes, teen mischief to worry about, activities to drive to, kids to drop off, conflicts to resolve, etc.

Could it be said that parents of an only get more free time as well?

I am an only child myself and as I got to be self sufficient we had family dinners, but my parents pretty much went off to do their own thing in the eve and we'd schedule a fun family date for the weekend, or maybe a family game night one evening a week. Otherwise I'd just run around outside, play video games, watch TV or read. I REALLY  enjoyed this model as a kid, and now that the tables are turned I think I'd enjoy this as a parent too.

It would be great to hear from you about the subject!

My Second LO was born 2/22 via urgent Csection (labored with pitocin and epidural for 24 hours, failure to descend and had blood in urine). She was 7lbs3oz, totally perfect.

 Despite my best efforts I couldn't EBF  (PCOS, suspected IGT) and completely stopped combo feeding about a week ago. We gave her Enfamil Infant first, then switched to Newborn when we got home,  then in her 3rd week we switched her to Gentlease. Since her 2nd or 3rd week she's had green poops. They aren't frothy or mucousy or anything, pretty much the same consistency as normal poop. They are off and on. Sometimes yellow sometimes green.

However at her 1 month on Thursday I told her doctor that she was still having green poops, and they did an occult blood test which came out positive.

So now I'm freaking out. There are no allergies on either side of the family. My ODD was also formula fed bc of the same issues and was 5lbs8oz at birth. She's 2.5 and still on the small side but smart and wild and healthy. This one  was 9lbs4.5oz at her one month (actually 5 week) appt. She's relatively calm, doesn't spit up much. Wakes up 2x a night but sleeps well. She does have a lot of farts and a facial rash that is very slowly going away but going away all the same. She drinks 4oz every 2.5-3 hours like a champ.

I had to pull her out of school today bruised and bloody. She is terrified to go back to school. She told me that she had been teased for a while because she mentioned she didn't believe in god (we are still in the South btw) She told me that now she thinks she was wrong, and that this was "" Gods punishment""....hearing that makes me madder than anything in this world. I have talked to a few teachers and the principal about the situation and they have not been able to help....I am probably going to end up pulling her out of this school.

223,"Hey there!

A few months ago I met a wonderful man. He is young (21), as am I (23). We get along very well, and we recently moved into a home together. Our lives are working out beautifully, and our communication seems to be very efficient. He has a 5-month-old son that I have fallen in love with--though I would never have imagined bringing a baby into my life before I met my boyfriend! 

Although most things seem to be going pretty smoothly, there have been some challenges that have surfaced, primarily involving my stepson's birth mother. She didn't want to have the baby to begin with, even threatening to kill him before he was born; my boyfriend fought to keep his son himself and prevent him from being put up for adoption (the baby's mother broke up with my boyfriend just a couple weeks after she became pregnant).

For the first four months of the baby's life, the BM had nothing to do with him at all. We heard nothing from her whatsoever, though she and my boyfriend have joint custody. But a couple of weeks ago she appeared out of nowhere and is trying to become involved with the baby's life. My boyfriend doesn't really have a choice but to let her see her son since he doesn't have sole custody and doesn't have the funds to take her to court for it. So, at least for the time being, she's directly involved with our new little family. I respect her role as the baby's biological mother, but it sometimes makes me feel like the ""fourth wheel"" to what would have been my boyfriend's family. I sometimes feel like I'm ""just the girlfriend""--I make the bottles, change the diapers and wash the clothes, but I don't really have a role beyond that. My bf has to be in contact with the BM in order to arrange for visits and whatnot, but he is attempting to be friends with her because she asked to be friends again. She knows about me but has expressed regret for not staying with my bf and ""having a complete family."" He says he isn't interested in being with her again, but at the same time he can't make her go away, so he might as well be friendly with her. Sigh. I feel like chopped liver, but there's not much I can do!

Basically the title...I have 2 boys, ages 6.5 and very nearly 10. Like any kids they love screens and when it’s playtime they’d go for their Xbox or a tablet every time if it were up to them, especially the older one. They do get time for that but it’s pretty limited (thanks parental controls) and when their time runs out, or if they’re already out of time when we say “find something to do, go play,” more and more often I’m hearing that there’s nothing else for them to do. 

Let me say - I am totally a believer in not solving this for them, not rescuing them from boredom, I know that coming up with something to do on their own is important, i am aware of the pitfalls of instant gratification and the benefits of struggling and problem solving, I use the “either find something to do or I can easily give you a chore” approach regularly, etc. 

Having said that, I feel like having toys/activities available to choose from that are age/level-appropriate seems pretty normal and I do think they’ve outgrown many of the things we have in the house, so it made me want to ask...

For those who have or know kids this age, what kinds of toys/activities do you see them reach for when screens or playing outside aren’t an option?

More not so great news this week.

We've been having growth scans ever since we had an abnormal quad screen. We did a non-invasive test and ruled out downs and any chromosomal abnormalities but the doctor still wanted to do monthly growth scans in case there was a placental insufficiency.

Good thing they did. I give the doctor some mad props for that. Out last scan (before this week) was at 24W. The kiddo was doing great 40-50th percentile in everything except his stomach which was upper 30's. No cause for alarm.

Tuesday we had another scan this week, again most things were upper 30's to low 50's, but his stomach was a tiny 3% compared to what they like to see.

My heart sank. The pretty quickly diagnosed is with IUGR meaning the placenta isn't working great. They through us through dozens of more tests and my wife was also diagnosed with Mild-Preeclampsia. There is no high blood pressure indicators or any of the other signs but the protein during a 24 hour urine test was high, so they went ahead with the diagnosis so they could watch it more closely.

The doctor's goal is for us to hold the baby inside until week 34 (6 weeks from Tuesday). Which is amazing and at the same time super scary. 

Starting next week my wife will be starting short term disability at work (they've arranged for her to work a few hours from home daily but only clerical computer work). We have 3-4 appointments per week from here on out and I am freaking out.

From how the doctor described it they are watching closely because right now it's best for the baby to stay inside. It's still growing (although slowly) and getting some nutrients from the placenta. At some point they can provide better care in the NICU so they just want to catch the right time for when that happens.

Obviously we are freaking out a bit. What happens if the baby needs help in between appointments and we don't know. So many questions swirling it's just a sink of not fun.

long story short our 4 month vaccinations were delayed a month as she was unwell at the time, getting three injections at this sitting.  In the days prior she had got into a good routine of only waking once or at most twice a night after a long period of being very difficult.

256,"Hi all. 
First time poster on this sub, and on mobile. We follow attachment parenting, did blw, baby signing, and extended breastfeeding.

We have a 20 month old (almost 21) and are due with another in less than 14 weeks.  She has been night weaned since 15 months and completely weaned at 18 months. She bedshared from 4 months to 16 months, and still as needed (bad allergy days, teething, nightmares).  We have a good routine of bath, pjs, teeth, stories, prayers, songs and rocking to sleep. 

She takes a 1 to 2 hour nap around noon (after lunch) each day. It takes 10 to 15 mins for her to go down. Averages 90 mins asleep. We also try to get her to the playground for 30 to 45 mins each day. On cold or rainy days, we try to find an indoor playplace (She signs play at chick fil a now). 

Up until about 2 weeks ago, LO 1 was doing great sleeping in her own bed most nights through the night. She did, and still does, wake between 7 and 8 each morning.

 She stayed at my just yes parents overnight when we went to SO's company party. We are trying to have her stay once a month to get used to it before LO2 arrives and she stays for 2 nights. While there, she stayed up until around 1130, (normally asleep by 8/830 with routine starting by 730). She ended up bed sharing with my parents rather than sleep on her bed there. Her great grandma was also in the room, so I'm not surprised. Since then, she won't go to sleep before 9 most nights and she's woken up every night and come into our bed. Most nights are between 2 and 4 am,  but it's been as early as 11pm. I bought and started reading the No Cry Sleep Solution For Toddlers and Preschoolers, but it's been misplaced in the holiday cleanup. 

We need her back in her room before April. She's in a toddler bed since I can't lean over a crib side easily. Her coming to our bed bothers SO more than me, but LO1 will be holding on to him and pet his arm for a long time in her sleep. It drives him nuts. I have my back to her because pregnancy left side sleeping.

Suggestion for resources? Please be supportive. I know we messed up by not putting her down drowsy and awake as a tiny baby,  but we could never find that window as first time parents.

It has been hellish, but my baby is perfectly healthy in my tummy and that's what matters for now.

If he doesn’t want something, he just shakes his head.  He doesn’t answer in the affirmative like his sister if he wants something.  He gets attached to toys and cries out if you take it away.

My wife thinks he may be autistic.  I’m not sure as he’s hitting some milestones, but not all.  Doc can’t see them until they’re two, and they can’t do any assessments until then either.

Little Bug has been sleeping through the night starting at 10pm and waking around 7am. During the day I feed on demand but will not let her go beyond 2 hours between feedings.

She didn't lose weight but she averaged around 14 oz a week while the doctor said she would like her to be around 20-25 oz a week.

I figured I would start pumping a little after each feeding but I'm a little inundated with the cleaning that is required. It's not that big of a deal but it is a little time consuming. After each pumping session I break down the pump and clean in hot water with soap. At the end of the day I sterilize. Rinse, lather, repeat.

I have two, beautiful, healthy, young children.  I'm a stay at home mom to a 33 month old boy and a 5.5 month old girl.  Our last year has been tough and stressful - I had a difficult pregnancy, and we sold our house and moved to a new area.  We've been in our new house for 3 weeks and we're adjusting to living very close to family.

My mother is an occupational therapist who works with pre-school and school aged children in schools and my MIL is a pre-school teacher.  It's not like I don't have resources and people who care. 

When my son went to his 2 year Dr. appointment they said that I should come back at 2.5 if he wasn't ""talking more"".  But at 2.5 he WAS talking ""more"", and there was so much else going on that I didn't make time to go back specifically for him.  Additionally, all along my mother has said that he's doing GREAT - not just ""okay"" or ""fine"", but ""GREAT"".  She's always extremely impressed with him and constantly picking her jaw up off the floor after he shows off yet another skill.  

When I took my newborn in for her 3 month visit, I inquired with the pediatrician about my son.  I told her he still wasn't talking conversationally... that he was certainly talking MORE.... But.... 

The pediatrician referred me to early intervention.  Between my mother and my MIL, I am no stranger to early intervention and I'm aware that it's a great resource.  But we were 3 weeks away from moving!  So I waited till we moved into our new house to call local early intervention services.  They arranged a visit and it took another 3 weeks for the evaluation to actually take place.

It took place this morning.

Allow me to give you the following background:  He knows his alphabet cold (in order, and out of order), he knows the phonics sounds, he knows how to write all the letters, and he can read a significant number of words.  He can write all his numbers, count objects, and count (by himself) to 100.  He knows his colors, his shapes (including rhombus, pentagon, hexagon and octagon).  He knows animals and their sounds.  He's sweet and he's affectionate.  He just doesn't converse with me.

The early intervention people were lovely.  They were kind and clear and helpful.  The evaluation went okay I guess, but it was clear he failed a number of things on the standardized test that I know he can do -- but it wasn't a surprise to me that he ignored requests or refused to do things when asked.  He always has his own agenda. 

Basically he's delayed.  Significantly delayed.  Socially delayed. Enough so that he easily qualifies for early intervention services and therapies.  Speech and general Teacher therapy.  I leaped at the offer of help and he should start treatment in less than 14 days.  We're going to get him to work on back and forth interaction. 

But I'm a fucking mess. I feel like curling into a fetal ball in a corner somewhere and bawling for hours.  I've started a couple of times, but if I really let it go, I'm not sure I could calm myself down. 

I know my mom is going to call me later on today to find out how it went.  I know my MIL is going to stop by on her way home from pre-school to talk to me about how it went.  A friend of mine has already IMed me 10 minutes ago to ask how it went.

I don't want to talk about it.  I feel like a failure.  I feel like this has got to be my fault.

I loved the interaction, feeling valued at work, having time to eat my lunch, being able to run an errand on the way home from work, etc. We had a lot of illnesses over the winter (RSV, HFM, ear infections, etc.), and while that was exhausting, I knew that is par for the course with daycare and it didn't really phase me.

However, lately I'm feeling frustrated with daycare- just the fact that my babies don't have as much time outside, are given way more ""junk"" snacks than we give at home, etc. Naturally, daycare does things differently than how I would do things and this hasn't bothered me previously, but it has been bothering me lately.

I approached my boss about changing my schedule a bit and to my surprise, he was very accommodating and supportive. I now work in the office 11-5/5:30 and at home from 7-9ish at night. This allows me to have mornings to hang out with the babies, do some cleaning around the house, or go for a run. I am SO grateful that I have such a supportive work environment.

Speaking of her mother, she is a drug addict. She has six children and has custody of none of them. About a year ago she gave birth to yet another drug addicted baby and CPS took all six of her kids. I hired a lawyer and proved that she had been living with me all this time and she was placed in my care. Her case was closed within months. Three of her siblings were placed with their grandmother (who actually has no relation to the children but helped raise their bio mom) and the other two with their father. Her grandmother made it clear that she wanted custody of her and that she would be better off living with her.

393,"I have literally not been around a child learning to read since I was 16 years old, and I definitely did not pay any attention to it at that age. I'm just really confused regarding exactly HOW other people teach their children to read. What actually works?

I have a 6 year old (7 in June) in first grade. He has never been in public school. Teaching him how to read has been ... Not easy. I've tried phonics, which was probably the most successful at actually getting him started.. He knows all of the phonics rules and he's great at sounding out words that use those rules. 

But he's really lacking in the sight word area.. And in fluency in general. He has issues remembering sight words. And while he's reading, he will stop and sound out every flipping word. Like ""has"" which he has read 1,000 times so far. He still stops and sounds it out even though he should know it on sight. He will stop and say h-a-s, has. Which obviously hinders reading fluency. I've told him that if he knows the word, he doesn't need to sound it out. But he acts as if he has to sound it out.

Also with other words he has read previously in the same lesson, he often won't remember them when they are repeated. He also has a bad habit of  guessing at words. Often when reading a sentence, he will read the words correctly the first time, and then at the end we read the sentence again (more fluently), and he will guess at the words and read them incorrectly (likely because he's just trying to repeat from memory without actually paying attention to the words that he's reading because he just wants to finish and do other things). 

He also just hates his lessons in general. And sometimes I feel like he misreads words on purpose just to fish for an answer from me. He can't read independently at all. I'm pretty sure he's behind, and I want to fix that.

I'd just like something simple that I can implement to get out of this rocky place that we're in and get him to actually read words on sight with fluency and catch up to where he should be.

Just a note - I don't want to drop money on a program. I'm not interested in buying curriculum, workbooks, or anything else. I'm not looking for product suggestions.

I'm only looking for a strategy to successfully teach him how to read. Something i can do with books / printer / paper / things I already own.. Or free online resources.

394,"I have pumped a few times already, but when I do pump I've pumped it all from both breasts so I have some milk in the fridge if I have to go somewhere and my mom watches him while I'm out. 

I guess my question is should I pump it all or should I just pump a certain amount? There was one night I pumped a few hours before going to bed and I didn't have enough to feed him so I had to warm up what I had pumped earlier that night. I want to start getting a small stash, but when I pump it just seems like there isn't enough there for him to eat later when he's awake and hungry.

Was it because it's was only like a week and a half after he was born and my milk is still catching up to what he eats? Should I just pump one boob at a time every time I go to pump so he has at least one boob to eat from? The latter seems like the best choice I guess and I just now thought of it...go me just now thinking of it -_-

396,"I have some questions for any moms that had to switch over to EPing either you EPed since the beginning or gave up breastfeeding to EP, I'm having some thoughts about switching over, more than likely temporarily. I was previously only breastfeeding twice a day and then pumping 7 times (I was doing 8, but had to cut down due to exhaustion). I'm having to supplement due to a low supply of milk. Yesterday I went to a private LC to talk to about my supply, we did a weighted feed and my baby only got 1.8oz total from both breasts (she told me 2oz, but every milliliter counts) she said my baby could get more and told me I was going great and supply was good, that my baby was tired, she was right, this time. She was fussy for the next 2 hours, she had to be burped and was tired, that's fine. Today I tried to follow her advice, to primarily breastfeed and pump after when baby was sleeping, and today I realized why I had to supplement. I breastfeed her for about 20 minutes, then let her nurse to sleep twice. She woke up 20 minutes later while I was pumping, fussing for an hour until I realized she was hungry. She was starving. I gave her a 3oz bottle and she drank it so fast, it just solidified that my supply wasn't up to par with her. I was told to breastfeed, supplement as needed and then pump, I've tried that already and was told on a previous post to drop one because I am exhausted. I felt as if I was doing better by her by just pumping, even though I know she gets more out of me, but not knowing how much she's getting is anxiety inducing and being home alone trying to breastfeed only for her to wake up screaming 20 minutes later, knowing I'll have to pump, it's exhausting. I just want to pump, probably breastfeed at least twice a day, until I can see my supply is actually rising so I dont have to scramble to supplement. I know I should have a bottle ready, I know that, I normally do, but it's also nice being able to hand her over to my husband or MIL for a feeding. My question, or rather questions, to you ladies, is what made you change to EPing, how do you handle that and child care? Do you have any tips to make it easier?

The plan is for me to sleep on the twin with the baby (it's a firmer mattress) and the toddler to sleep in the queen with hubby partly because she hasn't indicated any interest in sleeping on her own and partly because we have nowhere else to put her.

She's already woken once (10pm) and hubby snuggled her then she crawled away to find me so I half snuggled her at the edge of the bed and scooted back over to the twin once she was out.

414,"I just wanted to write this to encourage you ladies who might be having doubts about your doctor or maybe just aren't as comfortable with them as you'd like to be. 

When I found out I was pregnant I went to my ob/gyn who I had only seen once or twice before since we moved here a couple of years ago. She was fine at my regular check ups but upon my first prenatal visit, I started to feel uncomfortable. First off, her nurse asked me if I was having morning sickness and when I said yes, immediately gave me a prescription for Zofran. I wasn't even throwing up and I didn't ask for medicine but she just automatically assumed I should take it. This rubbed me the wrong way.

I had a C-section with my first child 10 years ago but I had done my research and knew I was a good candidate for a VBAC. When I told the Dr. that I would like to try for a natural birth this time, she literally scoffed at me. Then she proceeded to tell me about the times she had done VBACs where they hadn't gone as planned and that when your uterus ruptures, it looks like a ""war zone"".

I left my first appointment feeling uneasy and unsupported. And then I decided, there is no way I'm letting this lady share in one of the most intimate moments of my life, much less be knee deep in my hoohah.

I Googled doctors in my area who were supportive of natural childbirth and called the first one I found. I met with her and my experience was amazingly different.

I'm now 31 weeks and met with her today. I asked her about my concerns with episiotomies, ie not wanting one unless absolutely necessary, and about not cutting the imbilical cord right away. She was already on board.

This makes him sound bad but he's not a jerk in general and he does do a reasonable amount of housework (although we have a housekeeper who does the majority of it).  I know he loves our kid, so I'm not exactly sure why he's not willing to put in more time caring for her.

432,"I posted several months ago struggling with cloth and got so many helpful comments. I was really touched by how many people gave advice so I wanted to update and say thank you all!

Right after the post we were gifted several months worth of disposable diapers and we moved to a new washer so we took a break.

We’ve been back in cloth two weeks and everything is going great! I wanted to share what changed in case anyone else is struggling with it.

My main issues and how I fixed them:

1. Smell. I was following Fluff Love and trying to create a large “stew.” It was way too much cloth in one load and not enough water. I was also using too much detergent. Basically the diapers were simply not clean. My routine now is so simple. I wash my diapers just like regular laundry but I do a regular cycle followed by an extra heavy cycle. So easy and my diapers smell great. 

2. Fluff bum. When my son was so itty bitty the fluff bum looked big enough that it bothered me. Now that’s he’s bigger and crawling it looks much more balanced and as a bonus it gives him a nice padded seat!

3. Clothing. I still can’t pull off onesies without causing leaks. But that’s also been improved with age - shirts stay on him and fit better now and the simple diaper + shirt combo is so easy for changes and also adorable.

Anyway, hope this helps someone, and thank you all for the time you put into supporting cloth diaper use!",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

436,"I really don’t know exactly why I’m making a post about this other than I’m seriously lonely at the moment and I just wish things had gone differently tonight. 

Everything was fine. My husband got off work around five, got home around six as usual. Him any our one year old daughter played and let me rest. I haven’t been feeling very well the past couple days. It was nice to be able to lay/sit around for a bit. Around seven is always dinner time. My husband and little girl almost always share dinner since he eats a ton and she loves everything he makes. 

This is where things took a quick turn. My little girl had chili  and noodles all over her hands (one of my husbands special recipes haha). She came over to me. I was sitting on the couch in a very freshly cleaned blanket. I didn’t want chili on the couch or blanket. I know I probably shouldn’t worry much about that but I really take pride in my home being clean. So, when she walked over to me I said “No no no no no. Take it to your daddy,” I said it in a normal but stern tone. Nothing out of the ordinary but a bit quicker than I normally would. 

Well it scared my baby girl. I felt terrible and wasn’t sure what to do. During this my husband is saying how I scared her and I didn’t have to be that way. He also asked me to make her something else since I scared her away from his food. So I did. I made her more food and cleaned her up. Once the food was done she was sitting with my husband and he was feeding her again. So in the end she wasn’t hungry for what I made her. 

I tried to talk to my husband about him making me feel bad for messing up and he really didn’t have much to say so I just gave in and sat silently until he got her ready for bed and I told her goodnight, giving her kisses and wishing I could go back and not scare her like I did. 

I’m not mad. I never was with my husband. I was hurt by how he acted after. I just made a small mistake and I’m so upset over it. I would do anything to take him back. I just need reassurance from him but I didn’t get that. 

Don’t get me wrong at all. He is an amazing husband and an even better father. I love him so much. I could never image being away from him. 

And now I’m in bed. Without him. Not out of anger. He had a couple beers too quick and also from working all day he just fell asleep in his chair. I tried to get him to come to bed but he wanted to stay there for a little while. Now I’m lonely and can’t stop thinking about it all.

441,"I see comments from parents of multiples a lot on social media, frustrated with others asking if their boy/girl twins are identical.  On the surface, it may sound like a stupid question, but the reality is, its not as stupid as many think.  The reality is, identical twins CAN be male/female.

There is a genetic condition called [Turner Syndrome](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/turner-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20032572) in which after conception, the X/Y sex gene is mysteriously lost.  This results in a zygote with only a single X gene which will develop to be female.  

In the case of identical twins, it is possible for an XY zygote to split into male identical twins, whereas later the Y gene is lost in one of them.  The result is an XY male and an X female with Turner Syndrome.

Turner Syndrome is not all that uncommon, it happens in ~ 1 in 2,500 births.  But due to the rarity of identical twins, it is exponentially rare with them.

446,"I think this post is mostly a win, with a few sucky things combined.

So since SD13 came back from 10 day visit with BM things have been a rollercoaster. I always delete my previous posts because they usually include too much identifying info.. so to summarize the past weeks events: SD13’s BM has only 19/days a year custody after she moved far away (lost custody 3.5 years ago due to domestic violence and alcoholism) didn’t see SD for 7 months, didn’t talk to her for months until forced by the court. Last week she came back for her first longer than 48 hr visit with BM in 3.5 years and she said she wanted to live with BM. (BM has done a lot of messed up crap.)

Anyways it was a hard week for me and my DH. A child saying they want to live with the other parent is the last thing you want to hear if the other parent has nothing but awful, left the child, and hurt the child, has not provided for the child in years, when the other parent has costed us $80.000+ in attorney fees just to keep SD safe. And then to find out 10 days with BM was all it took, yep it sucked. 

After SD13 told me straight to my face she doesn’t care what her BM did to her, that she lied to me about everything she told me about her BM (I try really hard to not say a bad thing about BM, but SD was always talking crap on BM and I was there to comfort her.) I backed off completely, I made her food, that was about it, I wasn’t mean, I just kinda went into my room more, or just left the house, I was hurt.

My DH talked to our attorney, he said to not let her live with BM since we knew that wouldn’t be in the best interest, but to offer more time since BM will get more time in January anyways. We came to find out BM doesn’t want her to live there anyways, she wants SD just enough so she won’t have to pay child support, and that we have to pay her child support (she only needs 20% custody to get child support from us).. so that was out of the window. We offered another week later this summer to BM, she took that.

SD came to my DH a couple days ago and told him that she didn’t actually want to live with BM. I didn’t find this out until last night, DH said SD had told him she would tell me, but she didn’t. But that’s okay. 

A couple days ago and not really having any communication with SD and finally having calmed down, I just kinda sucked it up and decided to be an adult and took her to the movies. It was a movie me and her have been talking about for weeks. We had a good time.

From there things went back to normal. I didn’t hear a word about BM anymore. She was hugging, kissing me again and telling me she loved me. She came and hung out with me again. DH called BM and they settled on a week in August. 

Well now we know for the future, she just needed time to adjust to coming back home from BM and to probably just be patient. This was the first time we had to deal with this so it was tough for all of us. But now we know.

The sad part is, BM has been telling SD and her half sister (different dad) for weeks that she’s coming down this month for SD’s half sister’s dance recital. Both of them are excited BM was coming down to see them.. well as expected, BM has now said to my DH that she’s not coming.. we haven’t told SD yet, but I’m sure she’ll be upset. 

Bonus wins: yesterday SD13 came to me talking about tampons (lol) she’s always said that she will NEVER wear them. Until yesterday morning when she started a heavy period right on 4th of July when she was gonna go swimming. Her BM doesn’t even know she has started her period yet, despite having it for 1.5 years. SD doesn’t want her to know because BM posts that kind of stuff on Instagram (yes really) and SD is terrified of that, I’m the only one she will talk to about it.

450,"I tried asking this in beyondthebump but maybe this group will have more insight.
**Request –** Any moms who almost exclusively breastfeed ~1.5 yrs that have any tips for feeding your kid enough during the day so kiddo doesn't wake up 3x a night to eat. Or any moms out there deal with an oral SPD that have any tips!?! Or transition tips from breastfeeding to my pumping and a cup??

**Background:** I love my daughter (19mths almost exclusively breastfed) she is amazing &amp; hitting all her milestones; however, she struggles with eating solids.
When she was born I wanted to try breastfeeding but was open to formula, if needed, but she took to breastfeeding really well. She started eating purees at 6 months. However, around 9 months she started rejecting all purees but she started to love the meltables and other easy foods. I thought maybe she just didn’t like purees as much as the other foods so didn’t think too much of it – a phase. 

At 12 months, her classmates were all eating a variety of foods and she’d only eat crunchy items like crackers/cheerios. So we made an appointment for her to get assessed and she has been diagnosed with an oral sensory processing disorder. She is now almost 19 months and progress is slow. I’m grateful she is still healthy and growing well as we are still breastfeeding. She has been doing OT (messy play to get used to touching and working our way up to eating) and Speech Therapy (to work on her chewing etc as she only has 4 teeth and tends to let food melt instead of chewing). We just met with a dietitian to try and figure out what she eats and how we can move forward from breastfeeding.

I’m STRUGGLING. I know some folks love breastfeeding and the WHO recommends until 2 yrs but I really didn’t think I’d be going this long. I didn’t mind it but this last month has just been – ENOUGH. I want to be done for my sanity. Around 12 months she used to drink pumped milk or formula (when I wasn't available) but I don’t know what happened as she won’t take any formula (different brands or flavors mixed with different milks/water) or even my breast milk in cups or bottles (I’ve been trying so many types). I’m so frustrated and dad tries – he does! But she’ll throw tantrums and won’t drink anything but water until I come home. The pressure of making sure I can always feed her is heavy.

My husband had noticed I have been withdrawing the past couple of weeks so he is trying harder to acknowledge my struggles and it’s helping my sanity but I just don’t know how much longer I can take breastfeeding Additionally, I'm not sure if she is getting enough during the day so she'll wake up 2-3x a night. We can usually get her down once without feeding her but after that she won't.

My daughter has had a lot of health issues since birth and been in and out of hospital and the one thing that would always settle her at night, especially in hospital would be a bottle. 

•She never has bottles through the day and eats plenty.
•I have tried offering warm water instead and she pushes it away and asks for milk.
•I’ve tried totally ignoring her and she will sit up in her cot for hours just sitting there half asleep asking for a bottle therefore making her very tired the next day.
• It doesn’t matter if she doesn’t have a nap in the day or how tired she is, she will still wake up for one.
•She generally has a bottle before bed 19:30-20:00 about 180ml then sometimes she will wake at 00:00 wanting another 90ml and other times she can go through till 04:00 having 90ml and that will be the last one before she wakes up.

It doesn’t bother me getting up and doing this as it takes me less than 5 minutes start to finish and I almost do it in my sleep now I’m so used to it but I understand it isn’t good for her to still have them at night. Also she gets a better night sleep if she has them rather than sitting for hours asking me for one. A few questions if I may;

•How bad is it for her to still be doing this?
•Do you think she will just grow out of it when she is ready?
•Do you think I should just ignore her and eventually she will give up?

My DS son is 6 weeks old

He was in the hospital the first 3 weeks of life and the doctors didn't like the look of his stool or his growth rate, so they put him on a special formula (Elecare) so he could get more nutrients on the small amount of food he was taking.

He has a decent latch to both the bottle and the breast, but he doesn't always stay awake to finish the mere 80 ml we're told to feed him, so he has to be fed whatever he didn't finish from the bottle by feeding tube.  At night, we have him on a continuous feed via the feeding tube, so we don't even try feeding him with the bottle or breast at night (per doctor's orders).

We spoke about it and he knew I wanted to keep the baby but I'm close to his family and his mother kind of talked me into an abortion. It just seemed like it was the right thing to do with me starting college and my living situation. I live at home but I'm currently sleeping on the couch.
I had called to get the abortion pill which My insurance covered so he didn't have to pay a dime or do anything. So I decided that an abortion was not what I wanted after going to NY to get away for a few days with his 2 sisters. I just couldn't go through it. It's a baby and why should it have to pay for our stupidity. I made it very clear to everyone that I wasn't doing this for him but for me. It's my body and if he doesn't want to stick around then fine. That just shows how much of a man he ISNT. I broke up with him cause of how unfair he was being and our relationship wasn't the best because we had rushed into it.

I much rather this way for several lifestyle reasons, including we only have one car, my husband has to drive me to my appointments anyway because pregnancy makes me carsick, i get spontaneous tummy troubles that are best relieved by laying on the sofa in loose house clothes and using my own bathroom with 100x more privacy than a public toilet (*plus i'm weird about the social pressure to not be in there for more than 3 minutes even if i have layers of clothes to get hung up, plus my bag and a small child who's always with me. Other pregnant people have to use it, too! i just can't relax which makes things worse*), I have two other children, one who is 3 and can't handle hanging out for 3 fucking hours in a waiting room while a nurse makes sure i'm not getting up and walking around while waiting for my turn to get blood drawn and the other is in school, putting pressure on us to schedule everything carefully around getting him or arranging someone to get him, and so, we just plain don't have the 4-5 hours to take out of our day to do this. It's too much for us. Plus i'm just burnt out of getting blood drawn. I don't mind needles but or the actual process but, i don't want to do it anymore because...i'm bratty like that.


So, instead, i was prescribed a glucose monitor test, with lancets (needed to poke your finger), test strips, and even rubbing alcohol pads, and i test first thing in the morning and an hour after every meal and that's it! I set an egg timer as soon as i finish the last bite of my meal, record my results on a chart, and call it a day. for a week or so then turn in my chart.


**The pros**- 1) You can stay at home! That was the most appealing part of this to me. I'm a stay at home mom anyway so, getting a sitter for my daughter so i can go to an appointment is really just money we now don't have to spend. Which is very, very nice. And like i mentioned, finding someone to make sure my elder child is safe after school is now not a problem.

2) you get a monitor out of it. Not the most appealing thing, tbh, but, now you have one and a ton of supplies for it (i got prescribed a month's worth for a week). I don't see a reason to toss it unless i find there's no space for it anymore. Maybe i'll keep tracking my blood sugar sporadically for the rest of my pregnancy just in case. Haven't decided yet.

**The cons**- 1) you have to poke your finger to get blood 4 times a day. The nurse i spoke to was surprised this was a more appealing option to me because most people don't want to poke their fingertips. To me, it's not a big deal. It's slightly painful but goes away quickly thanks to the science of the lancet poker. (i'm not sure what they're called, i refer to it as my ""little bee"" because the lancet looks like a tiny stinger.) it's a 0.5 on a scale of 1-10.

2) an extra trip to the pharmacy and back to the clinic to give them your chart to review. Neither are a problem for me because my husband went to the pharmacy during my appointment (it's in the hospital we use and it's a clusterfuck) and we plan on going ahead and doing a maternity ward tour when we head back to turn in my chart.

Apparently “recent studies of thousands of women” show no increased risk of cesarean when induced in the 39th week. With my first baby’s lack of progression she said that doesn’t look ideal for next time. I asked her if she thought inducing then might have caused the lack of progression, maybe it just wasn’t time. She said at the time she would have agreed, but these “new studies” say otherwise. And that not letting it go to 40 reduces the stress on the baby from pregnancy.... umm, what?

For background: My first was induced, I labored 23 hours, was at 10cm, pushed 2.5, but I got an infection.

At daycare, she and another girl are working on it. The other girl is more advanced in the process but they are both SUPER EXCITED about going to the bathroom- like it’s a little club that they’re both a part. 

The problem: my daughter is only sitting on the toilet, not releasing. Sometimes she holds it for a few hours at a time, or recently she has been making sure to pee in her pull-up before she gets on the toilet. 

At home, she’s doing all the right things, asking for the potty, manipulating her pull-ups etc. with few accidents. 

I think she has a stage-fright issue and that it makes sense to ratchet down the pressure and let her propose “potty time” but apparently she gets distraught when she’s not brought along for potty time with her friend. 

She seems more excited about the “club” aspect with her friend, than the utility of actually going to the bathroom.

572,"I’m sure this is going to be a novel full of rambling. But I’m broken right now and need to tell someone besides my husband and our immediate family. 

In July, my husband and I fell in love with a photo and a profile. I know we shouldn’t have. People told us not to, but we did. I called our agency the next morning and asked about the 11 year old girl we saw and read about. Although she could have been anywhere in the state, she lived in the same small town. Her agency was in the building next to ours. Her foster parents caseworker shares an office with our caseworker. We hadn’t spoken to our agency in months. We took time off because I had surgery. But, they were still going to call us that day to tell us about her. 

Everything seemed too perfect. Everything was falling into place. 

We didn’t have our foster license yet, so we sped though everything we still had to do. We interviewed with her caseworker and others at her agency. We were matched. We met her at a matching event. Later her caseworker asked her if she met anyone there that she’d like to get to know. She said us. 

Then we met again, this time she knew who were were. We spent the last month with her. She spent the weekends here. We saw her at least once during every school week. We celebrated Thanksgiving. We painted her room. We decorated for Christmas. We went to her doctors appointments. She woke up in the middle of a nightmare screaming for us. She eventually called me mama. She called my husband daddy. 

I knew it was all too good to be true, but I figured it was the honeymoon phase and once she moved in permanently her behavior would change and we’d finally start to deal with the underlying issues. 

Her foster parents told her caseworker And their caseworker that there weren’t many issues when she wasn’t at our house. There were upticks of past behavior, but nothing major. We talked to her about it. She always admitted to it. 

A few days ago her foster mom finally told her caseworker what’s been happening. She’s been destructive and was having a ton of issues. Worse issues than they’ve seen in the last two years she’s lived with them. 

Her caseworker sat her down to talk to her. They talked for an hour. She didn’t show emotion once. She admitted that she was going along with this to get out of her foster parents house. She thought we were “ok,” but she really didn’t like us. She didn’t want to live with us. Everything was an act. She’s known her caseworker since she was a baby. Her caseworker was sobbing. She didn’t show emotion once.

The last month there wasn’t one sign that she was making everything up. There wasn’t one second that would make us think this was an act. She was on 100% of the time. We’ve racked our brains and nothing makes sense. There were no clues. 

He caseworker is confused too. She had no idea. She thought they were close and had built a good relationship thought the years. Whenever she talked to her she seemed so happy and talked about how glad she is to finally have a family. She expressed sadness about her birth family and how she was changing schools. All the normal things. She never let on that there was such an underlying issue. 

We’re broken. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to pick up these pieces. I don’t know where to start. I feel like I’m drowning. 

Now there’s this bizarre month of my life where I was a “mom.” Where my husband was a “dad.” There was a month were our parents were finally “grandparents.” 

To most people (people we know, not the people on here who have been effected by adoption and/or foster care in someway) it might seem like there’s nothing to grieve. We were never parents. We were just getting to know a child. 

I miss her so much. But there’s no one to miss. We didn’t really know her. Half of me misses her so much I ache. 

I’m mad at myself for falling in love with her. I should have been guarded. The other half of me is so angry at myself for falling for this. I feel like an idiot.

573,"I’ve been wondering a lot about if midwifery care was a bad fit for me, if I’m just being overly sensitive, or if I had a bad midwife but the model of care could still fit my needs. 
I went into labour at about eleven at night. Regular contractions that got closer together, small amount of blood with each one. After six hours I wasn’t coping with the pain well anymore, and had my husband dial our midwife. 
She and I talked for a while on the phone. She was mainly interested in if my water had broken (no), and if I had an urge to bear down (no).  She suggested I take Tylenol. I tried explaining a few times that the pain was too intense. Finally she suggest that I take two Tylenol, and try to sleep, and that she would call me in an hour and maybe head over for a home check based on how I was doing. 
At that point I just gave up on her, and said sure, and hung up. I told my husband we were going to the hospital. 
He was pretty bewildered that we weren’t following her advice, and insisted on calling her on the way to let her know. I was in too much pain and had pretty much given up on her as a resource to care, and just let him talk to her. She was polite but clearly disappointed, and said she would call ahead so that they would expect us. 
When I arrived at the hospital the nurses treated me like I was being dramatic. I had to jump through a few hoops to get my cervical check, at which it was discovered I only had a lip of the cervix left. 
I remember my nurse saying she had to go call my midwife so she knew to come, leading me to believe she had told them I wasn’t actually in labour and she hadn’t been planning on coming for awhile. 
I obviously missed my epidural window. I received gas and air, but it didn’t manage my pain and was eventually turned off. 
I was told not to push. My midwife came. It hurt so bad not to push, and I feel like that went on forever. Finally I couldn’t not push, and managed to say that I couldn’t not push. They just said, oh that’s fine, you should be pushing. 
The water had meconium in it, and they asked me to start adding extra pushes after each contraction. Obviously hurt like the dickens, and I’m wondering if running around and doing paperwork while in transition and not pushing when I should have been made it necessary. 
When we talked about pain relief we saw a paper with a ladder of pain relief. I said I was fine with all of it if necessary, and it was made to sound like it wouldn’t be an issue, but when I was in labour begging for drugs they just said there was nothing they could do. 
The other thing is that I had pretty bad tearing and eventually a surgeon was called in to do the stitching. There was a stark difference between the surgeon and my midwife. She had been poking around for a while before she made the call to bring in the surgeon, and every poke hurt a lot. I didn’t want to hold my baby because I thought the pain might make me drop him. 
The surgeon instantly froze me, and it made things so much more bearable. The surgeon also acknowledged my pain and explained what was happening, which also helped immensely. 
I ended up seeing discharge papers, where it said I had a precipitous labour. When I looked up the meaning of that, it said a birth under three hours. I feel completely ignored, because my birth was not under three hours.

576,"I’ve previously posted about my son and some behavioral issues he was having in this sub. Luckily, those have subsided and he is now back to his happy, helpful self. 

The only reoccurring issue is that my son will not in any way shape or form accept food thicker than baby food and has not since birth. We’ve taken him to occupational and speech therapy, feeding teams, and other specialists over the years who have all given various versions of the same solutions and none of them have taken. 

We found out a couple of years ago his tonsils had been swollen for a long time and he got them removed when he was 6. He had previous to the surgery always choked on his food because of his lack of knowledge and chewing/size of his tonsils and we thought afterward he would get better. Wrong. Then we started to see it as a psychological issue of him associating food with choking. So of course we took him to a psychologist, also didn’t work. 

Now, I’ve been giving all of these things a long go, months or years of time, multiple at once or dedicating time to one. He does have his school that would need to accommodate the changes and he sees his father’s grandparents for 1.5 days every weekend who have been helpful but often give him a little more leniency. 

At this point my husband keeps saying that since he can’t keep weight on (he’s almost 9 and can’t get above 50 lbs) we will have to put him on a feeding tube.

The general goals of these events are to stimulate discussion and promote community.  The specific goal of Media Review Friday is to promote a weekly discussion about books, TV shows, games, movies, etc. that are relevant to families.

This is a great place to share things like:

* A movie / TV show your family recently enjoyed (or hated).
* The book you or your kids are reading.
* Discussion about video games, apps or websites that your kids are enjoying.

I have managed to ignore this the last school year, but with each flyer it annoys me a little more. I am trying not to be ""That Guy"" who takes on a school district, but  think this crosses the line between separation of church and state.

What should I do? 

**edit:**
Thank you for pointing me to the FFRF, their site has been a great resource. It looks as though our school district may actually be violating separation of church and state for the following reasons:

They do not require permission slips signed by parents before sending religious material home
They do not have a disclaimer that disassociates the school from the religious groups
They have teachers assemble sort and distribute this while being ""on the clock""

637,"My SO and I (and SD too) can now breathe easy.  A couple of months ago I posted about a situation that we had here:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/cm41jv/just\_when\_everything\_was\_going\_great/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/cm41jv/just_when_everything_was_going_great/) 

For a TLDR on our overall situation:  My SD 15 came to live with us about a year ago full time when BM passed away from ovarian cancer.  BM was raised by her father and step mother.  BM's father had given her $$ towards a downpayment of her house in cali in 2007. BM's step mom and half sister came out of nowhere in August and had us (my SO and I) served papers that they wanted 2/3 of the money that is in my SD's trust to go to them and wanted visitation of SD.

In September the attorney for BM's step mom called our attorney and was very forceful that they wanted us to settle out of court and they would settle for essentially what would come out to about 20% of what's in SD's trust.  My attorney was adamant that we shouldn't even consider settling since these folks had no involvement in BM's life or SD's life for that matter.  They were invited to many events for SD and when we organized services for BM they didn't show up.  The last time my SD saw them was when she was a toddler at some sort of family thing in CT that my SO has pictures of. 

Anyway we told them no multiple times, we were going to court.  Prior to going to court child protective services came to our house multiple times to interview us.  That was pretty awful.  The case worker assigned to us was assuming we were bad parents and were hiding money.  Even though we have all of the financial records in order and pretty much everything that BM minus a small % we used for down payment on the house we live in (which BM told us to do that she would not take no for an answer and put it in her will) is in a trust for SD.  They showed up at SD's school and pulled her out of class and were asking her all sorts of questions around abuse which is not what this case is about at all.  They also asked if she was happy that her mother was dead. What a horrible thing to ask someone who lost her mother.  She got very upset and SO left work to go get her.   My opinion of child protective services is now pretty low.  My SO and I complained and were told these were standard questions.  

If that wasn't bad enough case worker from CPS became obsessed with the fact that I'm 40 and pregnant. She kept asking why I waited this long and made all these terrible comments.  

We had our initial appearance in family court last week.  It was more of a moderation session. I've never been to family court so maybe this is how this always goes, but I expected more law &amp; order, but it was like everyone in a room that looked like a conference room.  The judge listened to each side and then he called upon SD and she answered a bunch of questions including if she wanted visitation with her step grandma and she said no.

The judge complimented us and how we have made a good home for SD after her mother's passing.  Since there was no evidence either way that her Dad lent her money or if she paid it back the judge ruled that it get thrown out. 

Because there was a family court case we are required to have two more visits with CPS.

662,"My daughter is very good at going on the potty when we put her there ourselves. She will pee and poo on the potty at home or in a public toilet without hassle as long as we take her. The problem is that she has poor communication skills, generally speaking. Her pediatrician insists that she is not delayed because she has a good vocabulary, but she doesn't answer direct questions or respond to conversation, ever. For example, ""What is your name?"", ""Do you want a snack?"" or ""How old are you?"" will be met with a blank stare, but she will spontaneously tell us her name, age, and whether she wants something to eat or drink in a full sentence. She will not even respond to simple sentences like ""It's time for bed,"" or ""Let's go to the park."" However, she will say ""We go to the park now,"" or ""I'm sleepy, bed time!""

664,"My ex and I were together for 10 years, married for 8. We have one child together from the relationship: a 6 year old girl. Last October, I discovered that he has been cheating on me for at least the past year. I filed for divorce (finalized last week!) and will be moving across the country to my home state next week. We have split custody, where I will get our daughter for the school year in my home state and he will get our daughter for summer and spring breaks, as well as every other winter break in his home state. When I leave next week, our daughter will be staying behind with my ex until I pick her up at the end of summer.



My concern is this: his affair partner. I've been around her a handful of times, and each time I have been polite and respectful to the both of them, where she has come back with vitriol every time. I am worried about leaving my daughter in the hands of a woman who seemingly hates me, so I have asked my ex if she would be willing to meet up (all three of us) in a public place (restaurant) to discuss parenting plans for my daughter. She agreed, and we meet tomorrow morning to talk over breakfast. Unfortunately, now that it's actually going to happen, my mind is at a complete loss as to what to say/ask/discuss. I feel I need to do this for my daughter's sake, but I am also not looking forward to it at all.



My question is: what should I ask/do/say? and Has anyone else been able to sit down with their ex's affair partner to discuss parenting, and if so, how did it go?



Here's some (hopefully pertinent) information:


*Due to the law of the state we got divorced in, we have had to live together during the entire divorce procedure. He has slowly been moving his affair partner in while I still live here.


*We waited to explain the divorce/move to our daughter until we were absolutely positive what would be happening with custody (he did not want me to move to home state and agreed it was best at the last moment) so she just found out a few weeks ago. She has had little time to process the divorce/move. I'm worried that he will thrust his affair partner on our daughter right after I leave, which could be traumatic for her.


*He has been bringing his affair partner around our daughter since October, so our daughter knows of her.


*He has been cheating on his affair partner since they started seeing each other, and I am worried that she might go ""bunny-boiler"" when she finds out.

670,"My girlfriend of 18 months has a 4 year-old son from before we were a couple. We don't live together and mostly see each other on weekends. She and him live with her mom and younger sister. Other than when he goes to see his dad for summers and certainly holidays, I'm the main adult male presence in his life.

Me and her have a great relationship, but for me, the son throws a wrench into things. We can't have much adult fun without significant advance planning because we have to find a sitter, so we either go do stuff that we can all do (which has its limits) or just hang around the house (both of which get old fast). 

My relationship with the son is complicated. He's not a bad kid, but he's not the angel my girlfriend and his family make him out to be. He's stubborn, often belligerent, doesn't follow directions, super picky eater, never wants to do anything but watch TV, refuses to eat meals but then wakes up in the middle of the night claiming he's hungry, throws tantrums in which he not only makes a scene but refuses to speak about why he's upset which makes the situation even more difficult to navigate, and most upsetting for me: he's a quitter. We'll try to teach him something or introduce him to something and he'll either outright refuse to attempt it or quit on it almost immediately, even when it's something he's capable of doing. Perhaps these are traits all 4 year-olds have, but they seem particularly egregious with him. 

On the other hand, he's whip smart, pretty clever, friendly to most, full of energy and has a good, kind heart. And these are the traits people always bring up when they talk about him. It seems like I'm the only one who sees when he's misbehaved, which is not infrequently (again, probably common for a small child, but still). Arguing with a chorus of his cheerleaders makes me feel insane or that I'm wrong for not loving him.

I struggle dealing with the kid. It know it's not necessarily my place to discipline him, but at times, I don't feel like his mom, aunt, and grandmother are doing a good enough job of curbing his behavior. There's a lot of picking him up and putting him on their laps and telling him ""hey, don't do that"", but never any real consequences when he does it again immediately. And I don't want to see the kid punished, but I think he needs it sometimes.

I wanna love the kid and grow to treat him like my own son one day, but it's a difficult road. Sometimes when I'm around him, I find myself filling up with anger, even if he hasn't done anything wrong. We get along sometimes, but other times I push him away when he's trying to bond with me because of his behavior I disapproved of from earlier that day or week. Ifeel like maybe I don't actually dislike him personally, but just resent him for 1. being an obstacle to an easier relationship with my girlfriend and 2. being the result of parenting/disciplining I don't always agree with.

Anyway, I guess my problem is that I know I'm the asshole in the situation (or at least I feel like it) and I want advice on what I should do. How can I develop a better relationship with my girlfriend's son who don't like half the time? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend's son from a previous relationship is a tough cookie but everyone doesn't seem him as I do. Even with his behavior, though, I feel like I don't treat him as lovingly as I should.

673,"My husband and I are both atheists.  I was raised in a Christian church with a Pentecostal mother and an Atheist father. I went to church regularly and was a believer until my early 20's. My father never had a problem with us going to church because we were so young and he figured it wold work out when we got older.  He was right and as an adult, I am not a believer, but I am very respectful of the beliefs of others.  I very much dislike how polarizing religion is and really wish everyone could just keep their beliefs to themselves and get along as members of the same planet.  I know this is a bit naive, and I accept that.  Anyway, my husband is 100% different.  He views any non-atheist as an enemy spreading lies to further their agenda. When we were dating I found this to be annoying, but figured we'd work through it.  

Fast forward 11 years, we have two young girls (5 &amp; 3) and religion is really just not a topic in our home.  This is difficult because outside of my father and brother, my entire family is Christian. So my kids get tastes of Christianity here and there. But it's getting to the point where we can't just change the topic as a distraction.  We need to have a real conversation with our 5 year old.  

If I were a single parent, I would encourage her to learn about many different religions.  I would tell her that no matter what someone believes, it is near and dear to their heart and she must respect that.  Everyone is free to believe what feels right to them and she is, too.  I would tell her that as she grows up she will learn a lot about the world and one day it will become clear what is right for her life, but for now to explore and ask questions and learn as much about everything as she can. 

If my husband was a single parent, he would teach her that anyone who believes in God is spreading lies or is an idiot. That religion has led to some of the worst wars in the world and endless pain and suffering due to mis-guided ideas and interpretations.  That people use it to feel righteous.  Non-atheists are our enemy and deserve zero respect. 

So, this is really hard because we are equally her parent and equally have the right to share our beliefs, but I feel that his message of hate is unacceptable. He is respectful enough of me to have never shared these thoughts with our girls, but the time is nearing when we have talk with her about what Mommy and Daddy believe.  She knows that we don't believe in God, but we sort of just left it at that. She also knows that all the relatives that she loves and respects do believe in God. The situation has been exacerbated recently when she started school and became best friends with a Christian girl whose father is a minister. She hears many things at her friend's house and comes home with questions.  It's time to talk with her.

We're currently expecting our first baby (Yaaaaayyy!!!!!), and with Christmas and Easter and all that in recent months, we've been thinking a lot about how we'll celebrate religious holidays with our kid/s.

Her attitude is generally to keep her girls under her wings as long as humanly possible whereas I more inclined to prepare them for the struggles of adulthood.

Both girls are extremely sweet to me and feel extremely lucky to be a part of their lives. I was raised extremely conservatively in what America would consider poverty.

731,"Not sure if this is the best place to post this, so point me in another direction if not. I recently had my son assessed for ADHD. I suspected he had the inattentive type, though he does seem hyperactive at times. He is struggling with a couple of things in school so I mostly wanted to see if this was an issue, so we could have some resources available for him so he can succeed. But after completing and having his teacher complete the questionnaire we were given, he didn’t score high enough for a diagnosis. What the doctor did notice is that the co-morbidity section of the assessment pointed to anxiety. This is not news to me, he has suffered anxiety since he was very young (DH has it also) and it has always been a concern of mine, though I wanted to wait to see if it got better as he got older. It has, though it is still an issue. The doctor who analyzed his ADHD assessment said that a lot of symptoms that look like ADHD can actually be related to anxiety. She also said that the very things he is struggling with in school (reading comprehension, inference, inability to re-tell a story/passage) are also things that children with anxiety struggle with. Honestly he explanation wasn’t convincing, but her next steps for us were to either see a psychiatrist or a developmental pediatrician. I’m going the route of development pediatrician at this point, psychiatrist doesn’t feel right.

Anyway, what I am here for is to find out if any of you parents have been in a similar situation. Were doctors able to help your kid? What can I expect from a developmental pediatrician evaluation?

734,"Now I don't have it as hard as other kids my age, and I certainly don't get abused, but here basically my life story so far(also this is on mobile). My dad had a really cool job as an IT person and wouldn't be at home until late 6 pm, but only on the weekdays. My dad stayed home on the weekends and basically went full anti-vaxer mode on me(I am vaxed btw, he just acts as if I am not). From the day I was born to when I was about 9, he usually came home, said hi to us, went straight upstairs and vanished until my mom started watching her tv shows at around 8pm. In that time I would usually get some device like my phone or my mom's tablet and waste time untill I had to go to sleep. During the weekdays my entire day was fine, until it came to the weekends. As soon at it is 8 30 in the morning, my dad basically shoves me off my bed and tells me to go use the shower. On the weekends my dad has 4 phases. 
1: The weird( almost a perv) phase
2: the calm, ordinary parent phase
3: Full on anime fight phase
4: The lecturer

Phase 1: My dad gets really close to me at times and is creepy at some points. Although I'm a boy, he almost treats me as if he was a low level pedophile! Some days, he'd even take a shower with me or use the same bathroom as me even when I am occupying the space, and now that I'm looking back at it, I'm disgusted at him, but more disgusted about how I never told anybody else. Right now, as I'm writing this post my dad is making smooching noises and it's bothering me, a lot.

Phase 2: This phase is what everybody would expect from a parent, a nice, sane parent. From an occasional I love you to him asking how I am, he's nice and gentle. But soon it all changes when  I do one simple thing wrong. Apparently not pushing a chair 2 inches further on the table results in him going to phase 3, and trust me it's always a bs reason. Most of the time it isn't my fault at all, sometimes even his!

Phase 3: Shit's about to go down. I normally don't curse but just thinking about my dad acting like this is just, ugh. Before I said that I wasn't abused, and that's true, but the amount or times he's hit me as a child makes me wonder if I should've called CPS(child protective services). I remember him hitting me with anything he sees in sight, even hitting me with my sisters phone, my wet towel, and even A FUCKING HAMMER. I remember crying so hard my face was eroded by water. I can't even express how much pain he's caused on to me, and I even tried to kill myself once. Along with this sadness that he causes, I also have my array of 'sicknesses' as he calls them. Ever since I was born my skin around my arms and face have always been terrible, and over time I'm embarrassed to wear shorts, short sleeves, or any other clothing that expresses my skin to school or in the public. My dad buys these foreign essential oil packs and pills hoping it will help me but none have availed so far(this is what I meant by full anti-vax mode earlier)

Phase 4: Full on lecture. If me or my siblings do one thing wrong, there is going to be a big meeting for at least 1 or 2 hours long. In this session he would basically blame me for doing something wrong and vent all of his anger on me going off topic( for example pushing in chairs went from that to a full on closing the door securely but not too loud. Like how in TF did he get there?). I remember my sibling wanted to join marching band( and my other sister was already in it) but he had the same conversation that he had with my sister and it didn't even help in any way! Also, my sibling got hurt from marching band(very minor) and my dad almost took her out of it, and that was a day before the final competition. 

Needless to say, I've always had mixed feelings for my dad. Overtime I've learned to find a way to basically divert myself from his field of destruction and he rarely ever hurts me as much as he did before. If any of you are still reading this long post(which nobody would since im basically worthless), and you can relate, just hang in there. It gets better as time goes on. Suicide is never the way to escape, and there are many other places to get help and the life you deserve.

765,"Posting this in regards to the  2F I nanny for on the mother’s behalf as she is not super familiar with reddit. 

LO is 26 mo and has two older siblings (5F and 7M) and is demonstrating little desire to begin talking. In all other areas, she is developmentally on track... it’s just this talking that she’s stubborn about. I know that she can hear and understand what I’m saying because I will ask her to put her shoes on, put something away, eat, locate a body part, or point to an animal in a book and she listens. However, she has little interest in talking.

So far the only words she uses regularly are: ma ma, da da, baby, go, me, hot, ok, yay, pretty, and na na (what she calls me). She didn’t start to use these until about two months ago. 

She will also make an oink sound, a horse neigh, and a roof for a dog that she loves to do all day long. 

I think the problem is that she has no NEED to verbalize because we can understand what she wants through her non verbal communication (I.e she will pat the floor if she wants me to sit, Pat an object if she wants me to open it, point to food if she wants to eat, shake her head no if she doesn’t want something). Her siblings do not talk for her, but again, we all know what she wants through her non verbal cues. I have watched countless early intervention speech therapy videos and have done the tips and suggestions such as sounding out the syllables, verbalizing and enunciating the syllables when she points “oh you want an AP-PLE, say AP-PLE”  I noticed when I ask her to say something, she will make a whining sound and shake her head all pouty. If she does say a word it is usually unprompted.

770,"Quick backstory my (25M) girlfriend (22F) had a solid life for our age (we were 23,21 respectively when we found out we were expecting) I had just finished college and just got a good paying job, she was working full time. We had just moved into a luxury apartment and adopted a puppy. We did whatever we wanted, had no time to think about having a baby or anything (in fact I don’t even think we once discussed it, even in jest) we were living comfortably and I don’t think either of us wanted to have a baby. Fast forward about 6 months after we moved in. We had just come back from a vacation with some friends and she told me she was pregnant. She was visibly distraught and was like that for quite a few days. Neither of us knew what to do, we didn’t want this baby, it was going to ruin our way of life. 

Well luckily our families supported us through this time, and helped make sure we were on track with everything we needed to prepare. I was out of town for business when she had learned we would be having a boy (to which I was excited) and the next few months moved by quick. She worked doubles every single day up until like 2 days before she was due, I still have no clue how she did it. We saved every bit of money that we could.

Then he was born (1 year, 1 month ago) and y’all.. I have no idea why I didn’t want this baby at first. Ever since the first second I laid eyes on him he’s been my world. Before I wake up and go to work I want to check on him (although I don’t because I don’t wanna wake him up for my girlfriend to deal with that early lol) and I get so excited to come home and play and spend time with him. Used to be I couldn’t wait for the weekend so I could go out with my buddies, now I can’t wait for the weekend because that’s 2 full days I get to spend with my son, who I guess is my best friend now lol. I’d do anything for the little guy.

I know 24 isn’t that young compared to some other people who’ve had children young. But man I’m just so excited to be able to still be young when he grows up so that I can do everything with him. Hell I’ll barely be 41 by the time he graduates high school. I can’t wait to be able to help him with sports, fix cars, anything he wants to do.

I know this probably has been a ramble but I just needed to express it to someone lol. Thanks for listening!",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
771,"Quick summary.  I'm 37, this is my second pregnancy, di/di twins, naturally conceived.  My first pregnancy was a singleton, my son was born 11 months ago.

With my first son, due to my age, we had cell free DNA testing done, to screen for genetic abnormalities.  I've also had all the standard (and some non standard) testing done to see if I'm a carrier for anything horrible (I'm not).  We were planning on doing the same testing for this pregnancy, knowing that with twins, it's an imperfect science.  I just got off the phone with my perinatologist and he said that the American Society of OBs (I believe?) just released a statement saying that they did not suggest that cell free DNA testing be used in multiples, due to a lack of studies on the effectiveness and accuracy of said tests.  The perinatologist offered the possibility of quad screening, as that's been around much longer, but did note that it's got a 5-10% false positive rate, and given my age, it's probably going to be closer to the 10% side.

We're scheduled for the NT scan next week, at about 11+4.  To be honest, I was depending on the blood test to settle my nerves about something being wrong, but the doctor, who I respect a great deal, doesn't think it's a good idea.  Does anyone else have experience with any of these tests in a multiples pregnancy?  At an 'advanced maternal age'?  What happened?  Was it useful, was it a good idea?  I don't want to do invasive testing without a REALLY good reason, the risk of miscarriage, no matter how small, is scary, but I also don't want to have to carry a fetus that's incompatible with life because it's too dangerous to do a selective reduction by the time we find out.  I realize the risk of something being wrong is quite small, but I'm a worrier.  The blood test really put me at ease with #1, I was kind of leaning on that this time too.  :/",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
772,"Really needing some perspectives because (I'll just go ahead and blame them) these pregnancy hormones are making me a little sensitive, especially to pretty much anything my mother-in-law does. We have a great relationship, but shes known for being a little over-the-top. 

Just to give some context, my husband and I are having our first baby in March. We are so excited and so are our families. My husband is a grad student and we dont have a ton of money right now but are doing okay and willing to do whatever to make things work for this baby. I think my mother in law thinks we are one bill short of eviction and keeps trying to buy us really expensive gifts for the baby (my husband's family is pretty wealthy). It feels like she is somehow trying to compensate for the fact that we can afford some of this stuff ourselves. Specifically, she told us she would like to buy is a rocking chair, which is great. One less thing I have to buy myself. But the one she is wanting to get us is 400 dollars. I feel this is excessive no matter how much money you have, and I dont know if I'm comfortable accepting this gift. 

Anytime she buys us something, she tells me how much it was, and that makes me really uncomfortable. Is she complaining that she spent so much? Does she want me to feel guilty? Does she want me to fall at her feet in gratitude? I just dont understand. I also feel like, if you're going to spend 400 dollars on us, pay a hospital bill or help pay for something more important than a rocking chair! Thoughts?

We all sleep in the same room, 2.5yo has a single mattress pushed up against our queen, which is in turn pushed up against a cot for baby.

She never used to be like this but for awhile now bedtime is always a fight that takes an hour or two after lights out. We have the same bedtime routine we have had for ages, dinner, bath, teeth, nappy, stories then lights out. It started before the new baby and they weirdly sleep through each other’s cries and almost never wake each other up, so I don’t think it’s the baby. 

We’ve tried dropping her nap but then she is a meltdown monster from about lunchtime onwards, so I feel like she still needs the nap. At night she’s tired and yawning, but will fight it with every fiber of her being. I’ve tried to explain how good and important sleep is (explaining things is part of our parenting style, and often works well with her) but on this she’s just not listening. 

I am beyond exhausted and feel like a complete failure as a mother that I can’t get my child the basic sleep she needs. She’s tired all the time but fights her day naps too, often until it’s late in the day, then bedtime is even worse.

Do I just need to drop the nap and wait for her to level out? Does it work like that?

791,"So - I’m not a parent but I help parent and care for my 17 y/o neighbor. She’s had a tough life and suffers with emotional disabilities. One of the things I do with her is take her to Girl Scouts and all Girl Scout events. 

Today the Girl Scouts will be earning the “College Knowledge” badge. My 17 y/o is not college bound - she has had a lot of trauma which has contributed to her not being on track to graduate with a regular HS diploma. She has been at a school for kids with high needs for 5 years. She has much anxiety around school and her current reading and math skills are maybe 4th grade level. She’s smart and kind and eager to learn, but she has a different starting point and pace and needs help feeling safe. Among other things, no regular HS diploma means she will not qualify for financial aid, even to take a class at the community college. 

One of the most positive things in her life is her job in food services - she is learning and contributing there and I’m proud of her. After HS, she can work and continue to learn skills to enable her to be independent at some point in the future. It won’t be when she is 18, but she does not understand this. She wants to be independent right now.

She wants very much to go to college, she has been talking about it as long as I’ve known her. I get it, college has been touted as a pilar if success, freedom, and independence. I think she is coming to understand that college is not something in her plans right now, but she is sensitive about it. It is one more thing that sets her apart from the other girls.

793,"So I have been planning for a VBAC my whole pregnancy. I was feeling good about trying and avoiding the risks of C-section. I am 2 weeks away from my induction and growing more upset about it though.

I had my first daughter vaginally, however induction was not neccessary. My son was a C-section due to him being breech. This pregnancy has been high risk for numerous reasons. I am having a lot of anxiety about the possibility of uterine rupture and also about my induction which I found out would be by foley bulb. Prior to my first daughter being born, I had a traumatic and painful abortion. I am so sensitive to pelvic exams and anything to do with my cervix. I have an emotional/physical reaction to even thinking about anything to do with my cervix. I have been trying to work this out with my therapist but it hasn't been going well.

I can't kick the feeling that labor and delivery is going to be terrible for me. I don't expect a VBAC to be painless at all but I feel like I will be in physical and mental anguish even before there is a chance for any other complications.

Now, I would never encourage her to call me that, but if she's comfortable with it, I'm totally okay with it.
The point is, even amidst the feelings I was having toward whether ""step mom-ing"" was something I essentially wanted or not, it definitely affirmed to me that I'm doing something right in this little girls life for her to look at me as a motherly figure and feel comfortable enough to call me as such. Even if it was ""just a game"" in the beginning.
Her BM and FSD are great people and she has even mentioned that when they get married she wants to call him dad.

Is that the case or were you still able to do a lot of the things you wanted?

He’s not the most computer savvy person, and he was hoping I could help him by searching social media and what not.  He gave me all the information that he had (birth certificate and the names of his bio parents).  It took about a half an hour but I had found both them.  His birth father had passed away but his birth mother is still alive and also has facebook (which is also shocking because my dad is 65).  I gave him what I found and he mailed a letter to her.  It ended up being returned.  My father took that as he either has the wrong address or she saw the return name and address and sent it back.  He has since given up.  My question is, would it be appropriate for me to send her a Facebook message?  Neither of us want anything from her, we really just want to know her.

826,"So, the last couple weeks, my son has been acting... off. I just started a new full time job, I had to switch daycares, and now I'm facing a brand new living situation, and I'm having a little trouble. My son is having issues adjusting to everything new, but it seems to only happen when he's with me. When I'm not around, my babysitter says behavior wise he is great. There are no issues with his appetite, his demeanor or anything. 

But as soon as I pick him up from daycare, and get him in the car, the whining starts. He whines, he cries, and his favorite word for everything right now is ""no, it's not."" We went from living with just he and I to living with 4 other people, so I know it's a HUGE change and he doesn't know how to deal with it. He doesn't get as much one on one mommy time as he used to when we lived alone and I only worked part time.

What I'm wondering is how do I help him adjust? What things can I do to ease the transition into all these big changes? It's beginning to be very frustrating for me because it seems like nothing I do helps. I am trying to make sure I always pay attention to him when he's talking to me, but when it comes to normal, every day things like bathing, going potty, even eating, he HAS to have me there or sitting on my lap for him to even be calm.

828,"Some backstory. Me and my two full siblings were raised mainly by my father. He passed away a few years ago and during that time my mother remarried and has 3 children with her current husband. Including me the ages of all my siblings go 27, 25 (me), 21, 9, 8, 2. Also, my mother and her husband both work around 60 hours a week at all hours so there is no schedule in their house.


Now my mother and I have a strained relationship and only reconciled after my father's passing for the sake of my younger sister (21). I visit her and my half siblings around 4 times a year and every time I go up there I leave feeling sad for those kids. Comparatively to me and my siblings, those kids are extremely behind developmentally because no one is helping them with schoolwork, they are never allowed to leave the house or play outside, and they are not being taught any moral baseline. 


I always keep this to myself and try to help in ways that I can but I almost lost it at the most recent news I heard from my sister (21) that lives with them. The older two kids (9 &amp;8) saw a cat outside with a collar that was very friendly and decided they wanted it. So they brought it into the house and that was it. My mother decided 'looks like we have another cat hahaha'. I told her 'it has a collar and was friendly on site? That is some other family's cat. At least go to a vet or shelter and have it scanned for a microchip'

My mother's response ""Not this again! If you take that cat from them you're going to break their hearts!"" And then she walked into her room and went to sleep. This is incredibly wrong in my eyes and should have been a perfect opportunity to teach the kids ""look someone lost their family member! Let's help find them and be good people!"" My sister (21) has tried to find the owner's but the same thing happened with her in that my mother wouldn't let her.

The only excuse I can find for my mother and her husband letting their kids do things like this is that they are so tired from work that they have essentially 'given up' on parenting. To you parents out there, is this what that is?

UPDATE: I posted a found kitten ad on craigslist myself and I believe I have found the owner within an hour of the posting. They have proof and all the correct information about the kitten.

844,"There's an issue I have with a lot of the information and posts I see regarding life as a parent to a child with Downs. Most of the time it's portrayed as a very ""pink and fluffy"" life, and it's something I take issue with as a father who wants to be prepared for *real* reality, not a sugar-coated one.

I love my daughter, and she makes me absolutely happy and grateful to be her father. I have never met a human being who is so consistently happy and eager to learn and play.

With the exception of walking, and some talking, she has hit every one of her milestones early. She's cruising now, so walking should be very close. She's talking, sort of, mostly two syllable words, but she likes to stick to ""da-da"" or ""dog-dog"", sometimes ""ma-ma"" but it's rare, but I've seen that as normal for language acquisition as the ""D"" sound is easier to produce at first. My wife and I work with her constantly (the way we see it, we could spend a few moments watching TV, or spend it teaching her how to walk, for example).

I want to help her become independent, have a job, maybe even drive a car if she's high functioning enough. But I want to set realistic expectations for myself. My daughter seems very ""normal.""

I consider myself very stoic, I guess you can blame the military for that. I look at life with a very objective lens, which can make me seem sort of emotionless on the surface.

I see awesome stuff, like some becoming business owners. But, the stuff I read seems very sensationalistic, and almost always the parents or caretakers are doing the majority of the difficult stuff, the person with DS is simply the face of his/her project. I could be wrong, but it seems a lot of these success stories come from very well-off families who can afford resources for their child that most people cannot.

847,"This has probably been posted a million times so I apologise but I could really use some advice.

My (28f) boyfriend (34m) of almost four years and I had a serious conversation tonight about children, and I have always been adamant about not wanting kids and he wants at least one. The more we talked about it the more I realized that if I ever was going to have kids, I would want it to be with him.

Is this just me being afraid to lose him? Is it possible to go from never wanting kids to telling him we need to have at least two because being an only child sucks within ten minutes?

He's an avid gamer and kind of a heavy drinker, so those are both things that I'm not sure he understands won't last long into fatherhood.

At the same time, I know I would make a kick-ass mom and having a little one or two would make both of our families so happy. His family has really been pressuring both of us, and I know my parents would love to have a grandkid that didn't live 9 hours away.

 I know it hurts being the healthy one as you watch your baby suffer from physical pain. I know you’re tired physically, mentally and emotionally and yet you always keep a smile and a brave face on. I know you cry out of frustration when you’re alone because sometimes it just feels so unfair, and I know that your heart breaks every time  your baby cries from the physical pain that you cannot take away. I know you feel horrible when you’re forced to give the medication you know your child absolutely hates. 

Just know that you are your child’s hero, security and source of strength. Your baby sees and feels the immeasurable amount of love that you have for them. Just your presence alone already eases their fears. Remember that you are amazing, courageous and strong and that your baby is so fortunate to have you as their mommy/daddy.

My big uncertainty is traveling with the large stroller: We're planning to bring our baby jogger city select with car seats and glider board through security and then gate-check it. We're flying with Delta, and per their website it looks like this should be fine. I'm planning to remove the car seat adapters and put them in my carry on before gate-checking, since they (1) look fragile compared to the stroller frame and (2) are small and easy to remove anyway. I looked into a travel bag for the stroller, but it's $80-90 which seems excessive- does anyone have one, was it worth the money? Has anyone had issues gate-checking a large (but foldable) stroller and two car seats, do we need to scrap the idea and look into a double umbrella stroller? We like this plan because it will make getting through airports much easier and means we only have to rent one car seat (convertible seat for the toddler) instead of three at our destination.

We're not planning on having another pregnancy so the main trade off seems to be between causing permanent damage and side effects to the tear, versus the risks and recovery involved in the major surgery that is c-section.

This birth will be at a different hospital (Barnet).

Our first son is will be 2 soon so will the additional recovery time mean my wife cant pick him up for longer?

Day 3- nothing at all. He will hold it. He will show signs of needing to go. He is happy to sit on the potty but will do nothing. And through all of this, especially by the end of the day he is miserable, clingy, and squirming. We get him to sit, he will not go. And it was usually by this time that we would quit because he was just so miserable and we become concerned about holding so much. Last night he peed in the bath and knew he did it and exclaimed ""I did it!"" and he became concerned with farting thinking he was going to have an accident. He also at bedtime pooped in his diaper after a few times coming out to tell us he needed the potty and we helped him and he did nothing until he was half asleep and then he came to get us. 

This time we're on day 4 and it's the same as day 3. Miserable. Holding. Squirming around. He successfully tells us he has to go and we direct him to the potty and he pulls his underwear down and will sit and do nothing. We play, read books, sing songs, Elmo will call. Or we sit and watch his favorite show. He will sit for 15-20 mins and do nothing in the potty.

What do we do? He's the only one in his mother's day out class that isn't potty trained. They've been understanding because he's the youngest (and probably shouldn't have moved up quite yet) but I know they're getting tired of changing diapers. And frankly so am I.

970,"tl:dr - toddler declares war on sleep.
So, my 26 month old boy over the weekend decided that he didn't want to sleep anymore after he discovered he could easily crawl out of the crib. He even ended up with a bloody bottom lip at one point. So, after trying to keep in him in the crib for a night or two (failure...), my wife and I decided that last would be the best time to turn the convertible crib into a toddler bed. We did everything you were supposed to do - filled the bed with blankets and stuffed animals, read to him in the bed instead of the rocking chair like we normally and talked up the fact that he's a big boy in his big boy bed. But as soon as we walked out the door, he started wailing, jumped out of the bed (or even just running out of the bed and falling on his face) and heading straight for the door. Eventually he started crying uncontrollably. A bit of a backstory - my wife just gave my birth a month ago to an awesome little girl, but she had a really rough pregnancy so in the last several months I've done everything - put him to bed, feed him, wake him, etc. In that time he's grown really attached to me. Now that my wife is back to her wonderful self, she's doing a lot more - but he still wants me all the time. Also, he's a very stubborn and emotional kid - if he doesn't get something he wants he will scream and yell and even hurt himself. He's been known to bite down on his had really hard leave bite marks And slam his head against the door continuously when I'm in the bedroom changing or the bathroom. Back to last night - We tried keeping him in the room for a few minutes and not letting him leave, thinking that he would wear himself out and get into bed. All he did was hit his head against the door over and over again. So my wife (trying to wean him off of me) rocked him until he slept and stayed by his bed for an hour until he was asleep enough for her to leave. Before we kept him in the room we tried silently placing him in his bed every time he tried to leave his room but after about 30 minutes of that he was so emotional we just rocked him.

971,"tl:dr Korean adoption has many serious issues, how do we address them. 

Hi there, I am a transnational adoptee that has been on this sub for quite some time.  I respond to many of you through pm on my main account and have read virtually everything posted on this sub.  I guess I just wanted to just get some stuff out there I've been thinking about in regards to my adoption and some of the information I've learned about the adoption process in Korea.  I spent my whole life feeling like I was unwanted and unlovable  I was angry at my birth mother for giving up on me, and even more so I was angry at myself for not being good enough for the one person who was supposed to love me unconditionally.  I listened to my mother tell me about how much my birth mother loved me, because she carried me to full term and placed me into adoption so I would have the best upbringing possible.  But I never could accept this, how could it mean she loved me when she got rid of me? It just didn't compute.  I listened to my mother talk about the shame of being unmarried with a baby.  And I internalized it as, my existence was shameful for her, I was shameful just being alive. I've struggled my whole life trying to figure out where I fit in, never Asian enough for the handful of asians I knew, and never white enough for the people I grew up around.  I felt so isolated.  I desperately would like a reunion or some sort of information on my birth family, but the language barrier restricts much of the searching I'd be able to do were it a domestic adoption.  The information I have on my birth parents is incredibly generic, basically their ages is all I know, and leaves a lot of questions.  So I've been researching.  Researching the culture, researching the adoption process, trying to find any information I can to help bring me some answers. What I found was that the more I find out, the more I feel like I can understand what my mother was trying to tell me all these years and the more I can begin to understand the struggles and courage my birth mother had by having me. 

So to begin, a not so little history of adoption in Korea. Korean adoption began in the 50s after the Korean War.  At the time, many US soldiers impregnated Korean women and after their tour, left to return to the states.  The result was mixed race babies with no father figure left in a very patriarchal society.  North Korea at the time used these babies as fodder for pr for their cause, stating these mixed race babies were physical proof that America was trying to colonize Korea.  The S. Korean government deemed that the best solution for everyone would be to send the babies to their fatherland.  Back in America, humanitarian groups took up the effort and ads were placed in the newspaper with headlines such as ""a Korean baby for you"" - insert picture of cute Korean baby.  Korean baby adoption rates soared up until the 80s, when S. Korea began getting bad publicity for its high adoption rate.  It was looked at as a heavy baby exportation place and so limits were placed on the number of babies they were able to adopt out internationally.  Today the number is around 1000 children a year, compared to the 80s when it was about 8000 children/yr.  This adoption restriction made it so there is an increasing amount of children left to age out of the system.  There is no support for these children, in terms of social programs or societal support. At the beginning of Korean adoptions, the reason stated for placement was largely abandonment or broken families.  In today's society, a large amount of these babies put up for adoption are from a) a poor family who cannot afford to care for their child, who use orphanages as something of a day care, or b) single mothers.  I had grown up wondering why there was such a high abandonment rate of children in Korea, in a country that states that it is in a population decline and not producing enough to sustain itself.  Why abandonment was so prevalent they established baby boxes as a safe way to anonymously surrender your baby. I think the answer to this lies in understanding a little about Korean culture and lack of support for struggling families/single mothers. In Korean culture, while many look at the country as an advanced modernized society, it still remains a very traditional patriarchal society with family honor at the root of it. Even in this day and age, unwed mothers are a very taboo thing over there.  In America, divorce and single mothers are things that can be openly discussed, there is support of sorts to these women in the form of social programs and it is not that abnormal to see someone in that situation.  In Korea, being an unwed mother means the women face discrimination severe enough that she could lose her job, her home, and her family connections.  It is not unusual for people, friends, coworkers and family alike to cut off all ties with the women in fear they would be associated with the huge dishonor with having a baby out of wedlock. It is not unusual for a women to get kicked out by her landlord for having this baby out of wedlock.  It is not unusual for a company to fire a women for having/keeping this baby.  Did you know that when you apply for a job in Korea you are required to submit your family history?  And that it is not unusual in Korea to turn down a woman for a job because of the absence of the father. As far as social support for the women, if they can prove they are below the poverty line, they are eligible for about the equivalent of $70 American dollars a month from the government. Which is low even in Korea.  But did you know that when they determine if you're eligible for this, they factor in the worth of your home, your car and your possessions?  They factor in the income of your family, even though a good amount of these women were disowned by said family and that income is not a realistic part of what will contribute to the baby's rearing.  If your parents make good money, you are pretty much ineligible for the help.  Families that are struggling to raise their child are not eligible for this support at all. Did you also know that Korean families looking to adopt are eligible for ~$150 American dollars a month for adopting a Korean baby?  Regardless of income, they get double of what the government would provide for a mother who wishes to keep her child. As far as child support, it is required that the father pay child support in Korea.  But strangely enough, if the father wishes to detach and not fulfill this obligation, all he has to do is not fill out the paperwork stating he is the child's father.  He is no longer legally required to help the child in any way and the mother's paperwork alone stating he is the father is not sufficient enough to receive the support. The Ministry of Health in 2007 put out a statistic stating that out of every 100 unwed women in Korea, it is estimated that 96% of them will have abortions, 3% will surrender to adoption and only 1% will try and raise the baby.  This is a country where abortion is illegal, yet an overwhelming majority of unwed mothers opt for this because of social stigma and lack of support.  In the entire country of around 50 million people, there are only 33 programs to help unwed mothers.  But the vast majority of these are run BY adoption agencies, so oftentimes the women spends the time there being talked into why she should adopt her baby out and not how they can help her keep the baby.  It is a major conflict of interest.  These agencies get paid roughly $20,000 per internationally adopted baby while a domestic adoption will net them $4,000.   They encourage the mother to opt for international adoption so the baby will have more opportunity and not have to face the confusion of potentially seeing his/her birth mother on the subway. They tell her their children will not face discrimination if they send them away the way they would if they kept them. So what is the solution?  How can you fix the way society treats someone, a society which I am pretty detached from already.  How can we encourage a society to be more supportive of struggling families and single mothers? The adoption agencies are in the wrong to coerce a vulnerable mother into surrendering her baby while pretending to offer support, society is wrong for the way they treat these women and their children.  But saying international adoption is terrible and discouraging it only hurts the children who are already there, as seen by the international adoption restrictions already placed on the country and the rising amount of children who age out and are left to society with nothing. What is the right solution? I would love to hear some prospective from you guys. I try and support this movement by sending money to KUMFA, a Korean organization that supports single mothers, not associated with any adoption agency and founded by a woman who tried to place her baby and fought to get him back.  I try and inform adoptive parents of what my experiences were growing up as a transnational adoptee so they are better equipped to help their child deal with issues they may experience.  But it all feels like it's not big enough to make a lasting impact on the real issue.

This is one of the few verses that is found in the Bible relating to parenting. On some of the commentary it states that you should train them to follow the Word of God and teach them Godly precepts.

But could it mean more?

When I was a child I wanted to play the flute but my mother insisted I play the saxophone. So I played the saxophone. I didn’t enjoy it at all but I did it throughout high school. I think I would have done better if I had the opportunity to play the flute.

When my youngest son was in elementary school he had a difficulty learning how to read. I tutored him every day and made sure he did his homework before he was allowed to play. Yet he struggled with learning the alphabet because they were teaching phonics and he was more suited for whole word learning.[https://singleparentssurvivalguide.com/phonics-is-it-the-best-way-to-teach-reading/](https://singleparentssurvivalguide.com/phonics-is-it-the-best-way-to-teach-reading/)

I can remember the day when his kindergarten teacher started teaching math. She literally was exploding with joy when she told me that he was a wiz at math!

Considering I am an author and also a very successful blogger I could have shamed him for his difficulty with reading. I could have pushed him into something which he had no desire for. I chose not to be like my mother in that aspect. I chose to encourage and support him in his reading and stand in awe of him for his genius in math.

He has now graduated from engineering school and has a job offer which far surpasses anything I have ever been offered coming right out of college.

I think that the Bible may mean more than just teaching your child the Word of God. I believe it may mean to acknowledge the gifts which your children have been given from God and support them in every way possible.
