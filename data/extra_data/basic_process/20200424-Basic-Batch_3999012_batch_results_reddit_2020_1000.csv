3,"## 1. Allow them some ""alone"" time

The most important thing for a parent with a very sensitive child is to understand them and accept them as they are. A HSC needs their own space and time to recharge themselves. This can be as important as breathing.

### 2. Show some Empathy

 A common question many parents ask is: how to help a very sensitive child? All you need is to understand and be sympathetic to them. It is important to understand that having HSC at home might mean more stares, more emotional flare ups, more pain, and more emotionally intense experiences.  It is normal for the parents of such a child to feel upset from time to time and lose their patience but you need to work on acceptance.

### 3. Approval

 Never apologize to people for the child’s emotions and sensitivity. They are born with it and every time they apologize to people for being how they are, they may feel that their emotions, sympathy, sensitivity, or the way they behave is somehow wrong. This can lower his self-esteem.

### 4. Gradually help them face their fears

 Help them do things that they are afraid of or dread in a slow and gradual manner.  This may help them overcome certain aversions. However, this should be done at a gradual pace and not in a hurry.For example, a child may refrain from wearing a cardigan because she feels itchy in it.   You might ask her to wear it for a short time to get used to it and then praise her. If the sensation begins to go away, it may be worth keeping up.   Children may find it helpful to face some aversive stimuli when it’s not harmful to their well-being, but this should not be framed or used as a punishment.

### 5. Keeping a Pet

 HSC love animals, so use their preference and make the house better by having a pet for them.   Having a pet at home will calm them down, and they will also have a companion to play with. You may want to watch out for allergies but beyond that, a pet is a great idea.

### 6. Do not use common methods of discipline for HSC

 Using common serious methods of punishment such as yelling, and others will only make matters worse for a highly sensitive child. They can respond to this by screaming, crying, and throwing angry tantrums.   Therefore, disciplining highly sensitive children should be done differently. You should talk to them and emphasize aspects like consequences and well-being, helping them better understand themselves.

### 7. Talk to your child when upset

 When you see your child crying, ask them why.  Talk to them when they are upset and validate their feelings even when you feel that the reason was minor.   Engaging in dialogue and respecting the child’s feelings is especially important with a HSC.

### 8. Help them stand against the bullies

 Highly sensitive children might cry or be different from their peers, so they have a higher risk of being bullied by other children at school. In such a situation, first of all, teach your child not to be afraid.   If such a situation arises, tell them that they should put a brave face in front of the bullies and tell the teacher about it. As a parent, you should also go and talk to the teacher and the school authorities.

### 9. Do not try to change them

 Highly sensitive children cannot help that they feel the way they do. They are born this way.   Thus, a parent should accept this and not try to change it. Attempting to change this sensitivity would only prove detrimental to the child’s overall development.

### 10. Accept your HSC and appreciate them 

 A very sensitive child is endowed with many good qualities that you can b e proud of.   You will realize that they are more caring, kind, and sympathetic to people and animals than many children their age. They are very sociable and can read a person well.   They are usually very creative and may become great writers / storytellers, actors and artists. Therefore, accept them and appreciate them for the person they are.  the whole article====&gt; [https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html](https://www.empathsisle.net/2019/09/highly-sensitive-person-child.html?fbclid=IwAR3-EWcs2USCXHU-_xp0Ua3B8SckwCCSfD17o0tfpsQxvRrGx69SfTGiWbw)",True,"parent education,pregnancy"

I was told by my lactation consultant that baby has tongue tie and we should get it corrected. I found a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and performing the laser treatment to correct it.

However - if baby is primarily formula fed now (my milk production is too low to fully feed on breast but she still gets her breastmilk snack every feeding session) is it worth putting the baby through the procedure?

Researching online - the primary objective of this surgery is to help the baby latch and improve breastfeeding. If that is all the correction is for, I don’t want to put my baby through a procedure she doesn’t need...what do I do?

Edit/Note: Correcting tongue tie could hopefully stimulate milk production, however I’m currently on antibiotics so I’m unable to breastfeed for another week (pump and dumping). One breast does not produce milk at all. This happened after the last round of antibiotics. Therefore I don’t think the tongue tie is the sole reason for lack of milk production and correcting it may not bring my milk back.",True,child product

9,"**Education regarding breastfeeding should begin once a mother is**[ **pregnant**](https://pregnancycentr.com/7-weeks-pregnant-belly/)**. The biggest worry a brand new mother usually verbalizes is ‘do you think that I actually have enough milk?’ once they square measure troubled and feeling they’re not activity enough for his or her baby, is much too late. It is a small amount like ‘shutting the gate once the horse has barred.** 

 

**Why not teach them before the birth about the ways to stop this happening, to have a chance of success?**

**Often it is the new mother’s lifestyle that is the contributing factor as they have been caught up in the euphoria of the birth and a multitude of visitors! They are so busy pleasing the visitors by chatting, making tea, and showing off their newborn baby, they become exhausted. So many new mums are on a ‘high’ after the birth and try to carry on as normal. It is a few days /weeks later when they are having problems, that they realize they did too much too soon.**

## Breastfeeding mothers

**The key to establishing a good milk supply in the early days is rest. The mother’s body needs time to recover from the birth and to be able to make milk. Often it is put on overload! All the responsibilities in the house should be offloaded to another family member.**  **Expectations regarding standards may have to be lowered during this time! This will enable them to relax and reduce their stress level. Have set rest times so that if friends and relatives want to visit, these periods can then be avoided. It also gives the new mother and father the assurance of knowing there is space in the day for them. I have seen new parents weeping with tiredness because the doorbell has gone non-stop and they have been making endless cups of tea. Remember the telephone and front door need to be controlled in the day to cope with the night shift as well!** 

 

### how to increase breast milk?

**All breastfeeding mothers need to watch their fluid intake very carefully. This has a strong influence on making plenty of milk. They need to replace what they are giving out to the baby and drink enough for their own hydration and to make more milk. This is where a lot of mothers go wrong. My advice is to always have a drink beside them before they breastfeed and drink it by the time they have finished feeding. Water, unsweetened fruit juices or milk are preferable Very often when I have questioned a mother who is struggling with her milk supply, this is a key factor. She has just drunk her usual 3** [**cups of tea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Cups_of_Tea)**! Eating and drinking well are very important to produce good milk. It has been suggested that drinking certain herbal teas such as fennel, increases lactation, but the effectiveness of this has not yet been proved.**",True,child product
10,"**I'm not good at writing so if you want to skip the following text then you can read the tl;dr at the bottom.** 

Homeschooling can get lonely for some. I’m forced to learn by myself at home so I can understand how it feels. However, I do not regret it since it was my decision after all to start homeschooling because of issues with school (I’m too used to the British curriculum. American curriculum is not for me).

I’ve always thought of how to communicate with people after school if I don’t go out often so I resorted to creating a Discord server (Don’t know what is Discord? Find out more at [https://discordapp.com/](https://discordapp.com/)). I’ve had some experience making servers so I thought that this one would work and I spent a few weeks developing it.

I study under Wolsey Hall Oxford, a virtual school which sadly doesn’t have an active community platform (It’s newly made forum is quite dead). When I completed the ‘beta’ version of the server, I posted the invite link to the forum and it gained quite a lot of attention. The server was going so well until I got an email from one of the \[forum\] moderators that stated that they had to delete all of my posts and comments regarding Discord because a person accused the server of spam.

This really pissed me off at first because:

1. Despite being relatively new at the time, the server had a proper moderation team which took their job seriously (Once, the server got raided while I was gone but the issue got resolved in less than an hour.)
2. Issues and complaints about the server should have been directed to me or the Admins (Moderators), not the forum mods. To my knowledge, no Wolsey Hall staff joined the server.

After an investigation that lasted weeks, I found out that the person who reported was a lurker (A person who never messaged or set up his/her account properly) and it drove me to a bigger fit of rage. By that time, negotiations with the forum moderators were looking bleak so I gave up. The forum moderators made an announcement in regards to communicating with other students in their own platform, which didn’t really make a difference to its activity.

The server went into hiatus for months with me not knowing what to do next. After a while people stopped talking and the server became dead. I didn’t want to give up a project which I spent weeks on so I decided to make it a public HOMESCHOOLING-ONLY server rather than to keep it Wolsey Hall exclusive.

**tl:dr: It’s quiet. Please join. Homeschoolers-only. Ex-Homeschoolers are also welcome.**

**P.S:**

**You have to create a Discord account in order to join the server. You only need an email. It is recommended to download Discord for Android/iOS/Linux/Windows/Mac but Discord is also Web-based so its fine.**

**YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO TEXT IN THE SERVER FOR 10 MINUTES AFTER JOINING AS A METHOD OF VERIFICATION. IF THE LINK DOESN'T WORK PLEASE DM ME FOR A NEW ONE.**

15,"- inverted nipples, baby would not latch. I really wanted to breastfeed. The first night in the hospital I was crying all night - not from pain from the c section, not from pain to my nipples, but because we just could not make breastfeeding work.

- the next morning, I was offered a shield by the day nurse. I was in love - it enabled us to feed. He latched immediately, was sucking immediately. However, I was told I had to pump after every feed to ensure I was emptying my breasts. 

- baby lost a little too much weight in first week (went from 3400g to 3005 in 5 days, then back up to 3420 by day 17 of life). During this time we were followed by a lactation consultant as well. While we did make the long term goal of getting off the nipple shield, it wasn't in the cards right now. Without needing to supplement, baby reached birth weight juuuuust over two weeks. Doctor was okay with this weight loss and then gain considering the emergency section.

- when we reached birth weight, we were then advised by LC to wean off of pumping. She recommended cutting out night pumping entirely, pumping every other daytime feed for a week. Then to titrate down to once a day (she recommended mixing up the time of day I pumped). 

Birth: 3400g
5 days: 3005g

Today, 5 weeks 4 days, my dog destroyed my pump parts. I was dumb. I had left them on the coffee table for like 5-10 minutes. The bottle neck is likely still usable, but the connecting piece/lid piece that goes on the bottle and connects to the actual pump is destroyed. The neck is crushed, the part that connects to the breast shield is crushed. I had a good cry. Yelled at my dog (fruitlessly, she doesn't understand, but I was frustrated and upset and yelled anyways), then went on amazon and ordered replacement parts. Unfortunately, with the holiday weekend this weekend (Canada, eh?), amazon estimates delivery Sept 7th. 

So my question being, will my supply suffer terribly if I can't pump for a week? I'm stressing out a little bit - I was on domperidone because of my 'slow start' but after my month prescription ended, my doctor took me off. She felt I didn't need it anymore.

All the plans for me to be there with her and breathing exercises and things we've practiced go out the window, and I'm banished from the room, occasionally called back to fetch water, ice packs, and sports drinks. At one point the midwife says she's concerned that the room's not warm enough, so I run out to the nearest shop to buy a halogen heater. I stay busy by building the bedside crib and doing some laundry. Another midwife turns up, then a few hours later her shift ends and she's replaced by another.

And then...

I try to sneak a look through the door (nearly bashing the midwife who's sitting on the floor behind it), and they let me in to sit on the floor next to my wife, who's cradling a tiny little girl against her chest.

We carefully move up onto the bed, where I get to hold my daughter for the first time, while the midwives help my wife deliver the placenta. (total surprise: the cord is white once there's no blood in it.) They show her how to breastfeed, and she gets a chance to have a shower while I put on a nappy and dress the baby. And then they go through a few checks, fill in some paperwork, and tell us what happens next.

2030: the midwives have cleared up everything, helped me change the bed, and taken away lots of stuff in clinical waste bins. One of them will be back to see how we're getting on in the morning. And we're on our own, with our daughter, FaceTiming our parents to tell them they're now grandparents.

2115: the little girl is sound asleep in the Moses basket next to us - while we're on the sofa, eating the curry we'd always planned to have this evening to see if the old wives' tale about it bringing on labour was true.

Yesterday, this cousin came to my grandma's house to pay visit with his family, and being the only person near his age in the house I invited him to go for ice cream along two other younger silblings. When we were walking in the city he started touching my ass and asking me if i was ""puto"" (spanish despective word for gay people"" and if we weren't cute as boyfriends, i tried to stop him from touching my butt by taking off his hand but then he began to hit me in the head. After that he tried to Kiss me a couple of times but im taller than him so it wasnt hard to evade. All this while we were walking in the middle of the city, in front of everyone. When we got back to grandma's house, when we were alone he started to stand in the middle of the doors and he won't let me pass unless I ""pay"", trying to kiss me again. I told him that that was a bad thing to do and then he had some brief violent outburst. I don't really know how to stop him without making him angry. I talked to my grandma about it and she said that he was like that, that i should endure it. Then she asked to sleep next to him because it would look bad if i asked for another bed. He woke me up three times in the middle of the night touching my back, then he talked to me even when i was feigning sleep, and he was making some gutural sound that were very hard to ignore. Barely slept two hours in the entire night and now grandma says that he is going to stay for the entire week. I don't want to talk about it with his family because we arent close enough.

26,"A very weird phenomenon is occurring with my 5 year old son, and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this/this is normal.

Basically whenever I present him to a mirror, he correctly identifies himself, however he ""misidentifies"" me as a new person, with the same attributes as his father. He looks at my mirror image, greets me (with the usual greeting routine of a smile and a hand gesture), then when I make a silly noise he laughs at the mirror image. I then take him away from the mirror, look at him in the eyes, make the same silly noise, but he fails to acknowledge that.

To be honest, the doctor scared the hell out of me, talking about IVI and IVF, which we absolutely cannot afford. My husband is going in for a semen analysis soon. 

All of these tests were on day 2 of my cycle.

They did an antral follice count first and there were 9 on each side, total of 18, which the doctor said was good for my age.  

FSH:  7 m\[IU\]/mL (I understand that this is good).

Estradiol: 41 pg/mL (normal).

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 1.021 u\[IU\]/mL (normal).

Maybe there were other relevant tests but I haven't gotten the results back yet?

I'll be getting the HSG fallopian tube test done in a week or two and I guess that after my husband's semen analysis we go back to talk about results, but I feel like I am a bit at the whim of this office.

I'm also tired of dealing with the screaming before nursing and am looking forward to having some independence from the little guy. So at a little over 10 months into it, I'm going to cut out a pumping session at work. And then another. And then the third. And then we'll see how it goes. 

I've been reading the old posts on weaning and am so grateful for the advice and reassurance in those posts/from the community. I never questioned my decision to bf, and fought like hell to EBF until he was 4m old (was at work at 12wks), and I'm realizing that I'm feeling a little sad when thinking about weaning. I don't think he'll be upset, but I'm realizing that this phase in our relationship is coming to an end. And as awful as it was at moments (thrush, biting, cluster feeding, distracted feeding), it's been amazing to provide him with the nutrition this whole time. 

I guess my question is that after I cut out the pumping during the day - which feeding do I drop? I'm guessing the morning one since he doesn't seem that interested in it, and then the night one is the last to go? Is it okay to start offering a bottle after nursing before bed too?

My 6mo has never slept through the night. She is EBF and not on solids. She's never taken a bottle.


A typical night goes

6.30 - 7pm nurse to sleep or until drowsy. If not asleep she's put in her cot to fall asleep with pink bunny. Maybe some bum patting.

8-9pm up for a quick feed maybe a burp, maybe just a cuddle. Straight back to sleep. 

11pm - feed, back to sleep

1-2am - feed, back to sleep

4-5am - feed, back to sleep 
 
7.30 up for the day.

Sometimes I can be up every hour between midnight and 4am. Sometimes it's every 45m from bedtime until midnight. 

She sleeps in a cot in her own room as it's not safe for me to co-sleep. Her room is warm enough, dark, has white noise and she has beloved pink bunny. 

I don't mind the sleep deprivation (well I do but it's secondary) as much as the thought that by not teaching her to self settle I'm doing the wrong thing.

I think that even though she's up ever 2-3 hours her overall sleep is probably fine. She takes good naps usually during the day.

So while it’s not for me, i have zero issues encouraging a laboring mom to go for it. I also didn’t breastfeed my children but fully support a mom who wishes to do it - it just didn’t work out for me with my first child and with the second I wasn’t interested in pushing the issue since I was juggling a toddler.

55,"As we continue our journey using CBD, we continue see my daughter reaching her full potential.  We would love to share the benefits we have seen by using CBD.
We have recently switched oils to one that is CBD/CBG. It is an oil that has the highest amounts of CBG.  What is CBG? Cannabigerol is the pre-curser or mother phytocannabinoid.  It has a direct effect on the Enndocannabinoid System and cannabinoid receptors. CBG is very exciting because it helps with some many things that are beneficial for DS. A major finding with CBG is it's neuroprotective and neurodegenerative traits.  Also, it a very valuable resource for gut health, as it's phytonutrients directly attack infectious bacteria.  It's other values are supports bone health, improves mood, and promotes natural analgesic (discomfort relief).

One of my major concerns is the fact of so many children with DS develop early onset of dementia and Alzheimer's.  There are many studies that have been done or are being done on how CBD slows or can possibly prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.  So knowing this is a major reason I will continue to give this to my daughter. 
Update on Ari
Behavior: CBD/CBG have defiantly helped with behavior. It has gotten her out of the fight/flight mode.  A balanced enndocannabinoid system will bring anyone out of the constant fight/flight mode.  And we definatly see that with Ari. The crazy melt downs in a store or where ever, are very far and few between.  It's not to say she never has an episode just like NT children, but we don't need to walk on egg shells wondering if we should bring her places. 
We have continued to notice her increased focus.  This just adds to every aspect.  Being able to sit longer, be engaged in an activity longer.  With this she is then able to learn more and apply what she is learning.
Speech Therapy: We have seen great results in her speech. From going from trying to decipher her language to being able to have clear communication is happy dance in its self.  She is reaching goals in speech therapy faster.  So lessons are moving quickly.
Physical Therapy: I'm excited about her gains.  We use to set new goals about every 2-3 months.  Now we set monthly goals. This goes hand in hand with her focus.  Being able to focus and understand, her strength and abilities are coming at a faster rate.  It's so nice to leave every Therapy with a therapist amazed she doesn't fit into their limited beliefs. OT basically has the same results

I do believe that age does play a small part in her success, but the 2 together is definitely a great combo.

With sharing our adventure I have been truly blessed to be able to help other families across the world.  Many sharing similar outcomes. So feel free to reach out to me with any questions.

I put down a pee pad in the car seat and brought her potty to the door to bring to the car, and complete forgot it.  At the doctors office, she said she had to go potty but wouldn’t go on the big toilet.  She peed in the car seat on the way home and I don’t blame her, totally my fault.  I ordered 2 more potty seats and I’ll keep one in the car now. 

She’s been consistent with going pee on the potty today, and for the first time she pooped on the potty unprompted!  Huge accomplishment for us.  Btw, the book says however many times a kid poops in diapers, they usually go down to once a day when they’re potty training. Definitely not true in my kids case, she’s on 4 today. 

My husband was home and I had to pack for our move, so he watched her all evening. She’s been pretty predictable with pees so I feel safe bringing her to the living room to play immediately after a pee for an hour or less. He FaceTimed her aunt and she was busy playing and let one go on the carpet.  As he was cleaning it up, she was with me while I packed and I wasn’t super watching her closely and she pooped on my suitcase!  Totally our faults for not keeping a closer eye, and a good lesson for us to hold up our end of the bargain - to keep an eye on the time, the signs, and always have a potty available. 

All in all, I’d say today was a success.  I plan on waiting 1-2 more days and then officially venturing into block 2 - dresses and short outings.

I’ve woken her twice and after a bit, she’ll stand in her crib and say she has to pee, however, I’ve missed a lot more times and they aren’t consistent. One night she went 9 hours without a pee and tonight she’s already on 2. 

I’ve layered her crib sheets like crazy so I’ve gotten pretty good at pulling a layer of wet sheets off and putting her back down on a dry sheet.  I tried the fleece blanket trick the first couple nights but the pee somehow soaked through to the mattress with 2 waterproof sheets. I just deal with them right away now.

84,"Corbin James' VBAC Birth story


This is an update to the post I made when I was 14 weeks along: [Feeling Discouraged About VBAC but Can't Bring Myself to Choose Repeat C](https://www.reddit.com/r/vbac/comments/5c4uaz/feeling_discouraged_about_vbac_but_cant_bring/) 
I'll preface this by saying that even though my VBAC had interventions and complications, I am so relieved and happy that I didn't have to go through major surgery again. 

Earlier on, I was worried that the OB I'd been seeing didn't want me to go past 40 or maybe 41 weeks. I ended up seeing 2 other doctors in the same OB practice later in my 2nd and 3rd tri who were much more encouraging and optimistic about attempting a VBAC. I tried to request these specific providers for most of my remaining appointments and just hoped they'd be on call if I went into labor on my own. This baby seemed to be measuring at least a pound smaller than my first baby (who ended up being 9lb 5oz) which was very reassuring. Still, I kept telling myself I probably wouldn't go into labor and tried to mentally prepare myself for another c-section...

...Which brings us to Thursday, May 11 (I was 40w+2d). I took my 3yo to his gymnastics class and sat in the waiting room clucking with the other hens. While I was there I felt what seemed like strong BH contractions but shrugged them off, convinced that was all they were. Throughout the rest of the day they were definitely uncomfortable but I was still in denial until late afternoon/early evening. I turned the TV on for my son and started packing, organizing &amp; getting cleaned up just in case something was happening. At some point, I went to the bathroom &amp; out came some of the mucus plug, with the rest to follow a few hours later. By the time my husband got home from work I was pretty sure I was in labor, so we called my MIL to come &amp; get big boy. 

I bounced and swayed on the exercise ball while timing the contractions on the Full Term app. They seemed to start really picking up around 8 or 9pm, and they were close together but still irregular (about 35-45sec long and 2.5-3min apart most of the time.) In between contractions I chatted with my husband and we went over last minute plans &amp; instructions. I was in such disbelief that I had actually gone into labor on my own. 

After a while the ball became too painful so I put a towel on the floor and gripped the end of the bed while swaying back &amp; forth on my knees for each contraction. They stayed confusing and irregular, but when they started becoming super painful I just knew it was go time. My husband loaded the car &amp; we left sometime after 11 for the hospital. It's about 15min away so I had a few contractions in the car, and had to yell a little during them but was still excited and in good spirits in between.  

We got checked in &amp; a nurse wheeled me up to my L&amp;D room. The ward was empty except for us and the nurse did not look thrilled to see me. Contractions were coming about 2 minutes apart at this point. I went to the bathroom and as I was attempting to collect a urine sample, I felt a gush &amp; saw some blood, but wasn't really sure if my water had broken. I got into the bed &amp; felt a couple small gushes so the nurse took a quick peek &amp; said she didn't think so. She then proceeded to tell me this baby was probably going to be as big or bigger than my first. (WTF lady?!) I turned my head to exchange an incredulous eye roll with my husband, rather than punching her in the face. 

Apparently I was dilated to about a 3 so they hung a bag of fluids and said I could have pain relief once it was empty. This took FOREVER!! I focused on the center of a fan in the ceiling and breathed through the contractions for...I don't know...about an hour but it felt like a long ass time! They became excruciatingly painful, almost scary painful at times. My husband reminded me to breathe and told me I was doing great. 

At some point, the doctor showed up (one of my 2 favorite ones!) and I was happy to see her. She determined I was still at a 3 and there was a little bit of meconium in my waters. The anesthesiologist placed my epidural shortly thereafter. It got a little scary because my blood pressure bottomed out 3 times and I had to get the ephedrine shot each time to bring me back. After that drama, I labored another few hours contracting perfectly on my own but without much progress, which started to worry me. The doctor suggested a tiny bit of Pitocin to help me along, which was surprising and I normally would not have agreed to it but I actually trust this doctor. She reassured me that at such a small dose the risk was minimal. 

My husband and I slept for a while and in the morning who should appear but my OTHER favorite OB! She was still on board with the VBAC and upped my Pitocin just a little. For the next several hours, it was a lot of back &amp; forth with the RN checking me &amp; being very pessimistic, then the OB checking after her &amp; saying I was actually 1-2cm further than the RN had said. Once I got to about an 8 according to the nurse, my OB came in and said she could probably stretch it. So she did, and I started pushing. I'm pretty sure they had turned the epidural down some time ago because I had pain at the top of my belly and also at my right hip, making it harder for me to curl up while pushing. The nurse held my right leg while my husband held the left. I probably did about 15 pushes before the OB said his head was right there but he wasn't coming out. She suggested using the forceps, and I didn't know much about them but there wasn't much time for that so I said okay. It was really strange watching her twist &amp; pull on my baby's head with these things and I tried not to think gruesome thoughts. I heard her request scissors &amp; then a quick ""snip"" sound...Oh yay, an episiotomy. 

But then he was out! And he had so much hair! And they put him right on me! I said my hellos and told him how warm and slimy he was, and then watched as my husband cut the cord right there on my belly! 

Corbin James G. weighed 8lb 4oz and measured 20""long. The OB said the reason he couldn't come out was because his hand was up by his face (just like it was in all of his ultrasounds.) I got to hold him and nurse him there for a long time and was so relieved that we didn't have to be separated. Even after Pitocin, forceps, episiotomy, and a 2nd degree tear I'm still happy to have avoided the c-section experience we went through with our first. Recovery has been tough but not nearly as bad as the first time around, and I've been able to manage the pain with just ibuprofen. Corbin is nursing pretty well and had mostly gained his birth weight back at his 2 week appointment yesterday. He's adorable and we're so happy and proud of both of our boys!

90,"Dear Son,

Last night, I sternly ordered you to ""Come here.""  When you realized it was to give you a hug and a kiss, you gave that little squeak you've given when you're happy since you were a baby.  I hadn't heard it for a long while, though.  It damn near made me cry.  

We both know what we had before she left.  When she disappeared with you, I had to look myself in the mirror and take stock of my entire life.  Had I not fought to find you and get you, had I not played my version of Solomon, my entire life would have been a waste.  I feared for you, feared for what you would learn, feared for where they would lead you.  You were still young enough to have that unquestioning connection to the Sacred.  I feared they would destroy that, make you jaded and narcissistic.  I felt I had no choice. 

The other night you asked if my heart was burnt out. We've had no choice but to be dead honest with each other and I'm not going to change that now.  You'd see right through it.  So, yeah, this sucks.  I'm hurt that I never found the love of my life. You're seeing that right.  

But she's not not what I'd been working for since I was twelve.  You are.  There is no doubt that when I die, I will have left the world a better place because you're in it.  Everything I've gone through, every night I spent sobbing on the floor, every beating I took from your grandfather, every time I had to start over, every time I resisted the urge to end it, every single fucking time was worth it.  The promise of you keep me going.  I was either going to be a father worth a damn or not have you.  How many times did it gave me strength to literally face evil with a courage that wasn't mine?  

So don't worry about me, boy.  I appreciate it but that shit doesn't get me up in the morning.  Hearing that squeak, seeing you grow into your own person, seeing you have faith and confidence in your own ability to love, having your back as you become a better man than I ever was, that's what it's about.  We've both got a job to do.  Let's get 'er done.

I dont even know how to start this, other that saying im really crush, so bare with me with a long post.

Im a single mom, I got pregnant by a man who wanted a baby and was in a serious relationship. The same day I told him I was pregnant he said he didn’t want me, and although I did try to have a relationship with him things got out of control because he was abusive in every way you could think to me and later on to my son, feeding him with hot peppers so my son wouldn’t ask for the salad he was having for lunch.

I left him , and other than giving me money ( that doesn’t even cover 50% of his son expenses) he doesn’t see my son ever.

I met this guy last year, single no kids, for a while I would say we went on dates but nothing ever happened not even a kiss , but he loved children and eventually met my son and he was amazing to my son and I considered him to be a great role model. I thought there was empathy because the guy who I will call D , had lost his dad when he was 6.

I work with an intern that recently graduated but comes from a family that is having a really hard time financially wise, and I mentioned that to D. He said we should all go out to a nice restaurant and have a celebration for my intern. Soon enough that dinner totally turned into a match making dinner and comparisons started to draw right there. He went from basically denying we were close friends ( I mean so close we spend almost every weekend together, like my son and I at his place, of course me sleeping with my son, to beach trips , etc) to plain out loud telling her how good she looks. He would often say how impress she was by almost any coment, asking her for dreams for the future etc.

I hate to sound like a negative person but your dreams when you are so fresh out of college are so big, and often you realize that life has limitations and you wont turn out to be married to prince William.

He then turned to me, and asked her why do I always complaint about my job, that im such a negative person.

The girl back me up saying my job is not nearly as stressful as hers , but then he said maybe I shouldn’t cook so much for my son and get him use to pbj sandwiches and man up.

I saw her, she is in her 20´s and Im in my mids 30. I know I cant ever compete with younger people specially those who invest 3 hours a day in gym , yoga and surfing. I get she has dreams and ambition, and I wish all her dreams come true, and I had those dreams that were limited when I decided to raise a child. Limited because I cant work as much as I would because I have things at home, and I am sorry im not so happy go lucky with things because reality is diferent for me.

But I was hurt by my friend choosing to question my opinions. I was hurt that I was blindisided that he was trying to do something goo and maybe noble and all he wanted was meeting her and get a number. I was crushed that my friend, the man I admired was making me seem so small, instead of cheering me up when he knows perfectly well how this path is so often difficult and challenging.

That maybe im not a heroe, but I am trying my hardest to raise a child I didn’t create on my own and I was lied into motherhood wich a total different plan. I had to quit my dream jon, the one I was CEO for Latin America SALES, so I could have more time with my son, so no im not stupid or not educated,.

And now I am really wonder if being a single mom, chosing limitations as economics etc make you damage goods. Make you complicated .

119,"First of all I just have to say how happy I am to have found this sub! Just browsing through it has been a tremendous help to myself and my husband during this journey!

On to my question: My husband and I have recently deconverted. We're still ""closet atheists"" with our extremely religious Catholic extended family. We were both very religious ourselves (having gone to Catholic school and a very conservative Christian college) until very recently. However after both doing a lot of research we independently came to the conclusion that we no longer believe. 

The question comes in regards to my almost 5yr old daughter. I was a very ""good Catholic mom"" in that I taught her a lot about heaven and prayer (nothing about hell thankfully) and we attended mass regularly and talked about The Virgin Mary etc. and now I'm at a loss for how to undo it all. I don't want to just go up to her one day and say ""yea all that stuff about god and heaven etc was all made up."" because I'm concerned that it might really upset her.

My husband thinks that just letting it fade from her memory and not going to mass is a good idea for now but she's very inquisitive (which is wonderful!) and I know this will come up sooner rather than later. 

So any advice on how I should approach it and undo this? 

(Also as a side note if anyone has advice on how to gently break it to my extremely devout conservative Catholic mother...without breaking her heart... that her grandchildren will no longer be receiving any sacraments or going to mass would be greatly appreciated!)",True,

123,"First off, sorry if this comes across disjointed or I ramble, I’m trying to get it all off my chest and I’m just typing whatever comes to mind. 

My partner and I have been together 11years and have three children 9,6 and 2. Our relationship has always been very strong and loving, we’ve had our ups and downs and we’ve treated each other like shit at times but we’ve always worked through our problems and come out the other side stronger and more grateful for what we have.  I honestly cannot ever imagine my life without him but this seems to be a recurring argument that we just cannot seem to settle on. We will argue about it, cool off and go back to how things were before but I’m getting close to breaking point now and I’m not sure if it’s me being unreasonable or if I am actually right in feeling so fed up. 

We got together long distance and after seeing each other only at weekends for a year I moved to his area and we rented a house together. I had been offered a place to start university to become a teacher and was actively looking for jobs when I found out I was pregnant with our first child. Nobody wanted to hire me being pregnant and I decided the best thing to do was defer my uni place for a year and start when our baby was 6months old (his mum looked after our child whilst I was in lectures etc). We followed the plan and I graduated 3years later whilst ready to pop with our second child. This has meant that from the very beginning my partner has provided for me on his own. And now 11years and three kids later he still does. There has never been an opportunity for me to work, even part time. Childcare is horrendously expensive and it makes no sense to either of us for me to put our youngest in childcare just so that all my work pay would go on paying for said childcare. I completely understand how lucky I am to have been able to bring up all of our children and be home to witness every milestone and school achievement while my OH has had to miss a lot through working. 

He wakes up at 5am mon-Friday, leaves at 6am and drives an hour to work where he does manual labour for 10/12 hours a day only to do the hour drive home and see kids for just an hour or so before their bedtime or sometimes not at all. I am so so grateful for all of his hard work and I tell him all the time how much he is appreciated and loved. I’ve even offered to work weekends so that I can bring in a little extra money as I feel so guilty that I cannot contribute financially. We do struggle on one income and he gets extremely worried how we will get through some months, but he won’t entertain the idea of me working weekends and says that the weekends are for us to spend together which I totally get and I feel very lucky for him to pick family time over money. It’s important to add that he is self employed so his pay can vary drastically from month to month. He doesn’t get any paid holiday or sick time and so every day off (especially the two weeks of Xmas) means he is loosing out on money that he will not get back. Of course this all adds to his stress. 

So anyway on to my issue. As a SAHM I expect and am totally happy to look after the kids and keep the household going. I do all the breakfasts and get the kids ready for school then spend the day with our youngest whilst tidying, sorting life admin and running errands, then once the two eldest are back from school I do any homework/reading/spellings they have to do, cook dinner every night and tidy the house again either just before they go to bed or after. I basically never stop. My head is a jumble of school activities and other appointments I need to remember, making sure the kids are always fed, clean and happy, keeping the house tidy and on top of that dealing with my narcissistic mother which I am currently on a waiting list to see a therapist for as she has/does cause me an immeasurable amount of stress. I have no down time apart from a few hours in the evening and even then I still have to shower and look after myself which if I’m being honest is the last thing I want to do.

As soon as my OH is home his tea is either nearly ready for him (once he has showered) or is on the table waiting for him. He doesn’t and hasn’t ever cooked in all the years we’ve been together (apart from the odd omelette and beans for the kids once in a blue moon or oven food which even then I have to either instruct him how to do it or intervene eventually), he doesn’t ever use his initiative to tidy up or help around the house but every so often (maybe every couple of months) will go on mad cleaning sprees where he tuts and huffs because the place is such a mess (it’s usually if I’ve been out all day or just not had the energy to do everything on my ever growing list). He has never done homework or spellings or reading with the kids (he only found out last week that our youngest has had a reading diary for the last two years that I have to fill out and leave comments in daily otherwise the school will bollock me/not change my youngest’s reading book). He never puts his dirty clothes in the washing basket, just leaves them lying about and I’m
pretty sure he has no clue how to use the washing machine. He doesn’t clear his plate away after eating (putting leftover food in the bin then putting plate in the sink to be washed) even though the kids know to do it, even our youngest at the age of 2 does it.

The latest thing, which has tipped me over the edge recently is him having a go at me for not cleaning out the car regularly enough. I’m not just talking about getting all the coats, socks, toys, drinks bottles etc out of it, which I do already, but a whole fucking valet! He wants it hoovered and polished too. We brought the car (a sporty hatchback, his choice) a few months ago after having a very old, rundown and unreliable car for the last couple of years. I get that he is proud of it and wants to keep it tidy but if he thought a family of five sharing a smallish car wasn’t going to end up with muddy footprints and crumbs all over it then he should’ve brought something older and bigger. Yes we both drive it but it was his choice of car, his baby (god that sounds so cringy sorry!) so I don’t see why he can’t make the effort once a week or whenever he sees fit to clean it himself. When does he want me to do this car cleaning exactly, in the middle of the night when I’ve finally got everything else done?! 

Guys I’m so sorry for the rant but I just wanted to get it all down so you can read all the evidence. I know I’ve probably made him out to sound like a horrible person but he is such a great dad and partner in every other way and he always puts us first before himself. Our relationship is great apart this issue and that’s why I struggle to hold my own and stick to my guns when an argument about this arises. 

His argument is that he works 12hr days, has all the stress of having to pay for us all and find the money for everything and” if it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t have a house that needs cleaning or any food to make dinner with in the first place”. Every time we argue he ends up just making me feel like I’m being a spoilt brat and majorly ungrateful and I end up just feeling like my feelings are inferior to his. And as I said before, we cool off and things pick up as normal which only adds to me feeling like maybe I’m being too harsh on him. 

It’s only ever us, my family lives hours away and I have major trouble with them. And his parents/family live 45mins away but never come to visit, ring to ask how the kids are or offer to help out it’s always one sided with us doing all the visiting etc so the kids don’t miss out completely but we never get time for ourselves separately or together which of course only adds to both of our stresses. We’ve not had a date night in over 3years. 

Am I being unreasonable here? Or do I have a solid argument about the way things are? I have no idea how to fix this without an argument that leads to no change, only resentment. I do not want to and would not tear my family apart over this but sometimes I just feel like running away. I don’t want to be the house cook and cleaner for the rest of my life.  Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you x",True,discipline
124,"First pardon me if I make mistakes my English is not my main language.

I want to know what you, people on reddit think about my sister's behavior. I'm going to do something and I need advice. She has a 13 years old boy I'm gonna use (child) for his name. (I have to say he has not 13 YO mentally, slightly autism).

She (31) moved with her son to live with my mother in June after leaving a 6 years bad relationship. 

The thing I want your opinion is that, Sunday she said to my mother I'm gonna go pick up (child) to the bus station (in other city). Phone ring, its (child), he said my mom's not here its an hour I wait she doesn't answer the cellular.... My mom tried to call her and no answer, then I text her no answer. 
he waited 3 hours in the bus station and it was cold outside and she never get there. So his uncle (father's side) bring him back to my mother's apt at 22:30. 
Still no new about her, where she is? Something happen? 
Everybody went sleeping.


In the morning she's not there and no new, thankfully my mom was there for him she never works on Monday. 
Sister never went working, my mom decided to call the police (after my nephew get on the bus for the school) to see if she was in hospital... nothing and they tell my mom to call at 17:30 to make a report.


A little before noon she finally text me and said WTF everything was supposed to be ok, I went there and waited 2 hours and I never saw (child). I said stop lying he was there with the uncle for 3 hours. Then she change the story  I don't understand, I called the grandmother to tell her I will go tomorrow, Monday pick up (child). (hummmm he has school the Monday) I said you lie, if you really called the grandmother why she didn't call (child)'s uncle on the cellular to tell him to not wait there 3 hours. You're story doesn't make sense, why you lie. Why you choose to go fuck with a guy instead pick up your son? And even if you called the grandmother why would you like to make your son miss one day of school because you want a fuck with a guy?
She stress out my mother and (child). 


It's not the first time she does that, she returned living with my mother when she left (child)'s father (he was a baby). She left during the night a couple time to go fuck with guys letting the kid in the crib. Thankfully again my mother was there, after 3-4 times I was really fed up and went there pick up my nephew and all his things with me for a year.  
She got a BF, she seemed good and a weekend she didn't want return the baby home. So can't do nothing its not my kid, I don't have legal right on him.
Big mistake, (child) was in the bedroom all the time because BF didn't like (child). Drug/alcohol users.
She finally left him I let her my apt because I bought a condo (apt). Couple month later she ask for money because she didn't pay her bill so no phone, electricity and she was 6-8 month without paying her rent.
I was really fed up and called my father to come pick up her and (kid) and take care of them. My sister and I was long time without talking to each other because I do not accept her behavior and wanted to protect her kid. 

She was far from mother/sisters for 6 years. We thought she changed but of course not. 
She find a bad guy drugs/alcohol, mistreated my nephew, beating him (her) degradation..... She receive a complain from father's grand parent, police DPJ(kids protection) when there but she lie so well, she get everybody in her pocket.

This years she said to everybody she changed want to leave that bad guy but doesn't have money to move (she was leaving 6 hours from us)  She left (my cousin helped her to move) and went live with my mother again in a 2 bedroom apt. She sleep with her son in the same bed. 
She was supposed saving money to buy furniture (she left everything to the guy) to get an apt soon as possible. 
She still without money even with a job, she go in club or friend every weekend alcohols/drugs spending money for no reason but never on (child).



I feel so bad for my nephew  even with the grandparents complain we could not save him from that bad situation, but now he's 13 YO and renewed with his father and I want to talk to him so he can get the custody to my nephew. 

I wonder if I do that its bad, (child) was mistreated since he was young. She's a very bad mother, irresponsible on everything. I helped her a lots, food, money, I gave her good advice, how to do a budget.... But she didn't learn nothing, she's still the same person but recently I realized she's worst.

I didn't give you all details because my post will be too long but I really want the best for (child) and its not with her. Not that I hate my sister but she clearly has mental disorder (we thought bipolar).

So you guys what do you think? I'm a mother of a 8 YO boy and he's my life, never miss something and when I see her treat him like a shit thats break my heart.

125,"First time ever posting to reddit so please forgive me lol. 

Bit of background info, with my bf 4 years and living together with our own ds age 3 (Ino, fell pregnant quite early in the relationship but best thing ever, he was born prematurely and had a rough start to life but that’s another story for another day) anyways he also has a dd7 with his ex (bitch made my life hell and still is).
So bm rules the roost. She tells bf when he gets to keep the child overnight(up until recently it was EVERY Saturday night and Sunday- I had to fight a very long time to get it changed to every other Saturday night as I was going to off my mind from having zero social life and even yet it’s maybe once every two months we get a Saturday to ourselves) he also gets her an evening after school, how much money he has to give her weekly, who can and can’t go to school events (guess who’s always not allowed, yep you guessed right- me) what Santa has to leave at our house for her etc. 

Anyways to the point lol.. when sdd comes to our house she will not bring any toys with her so she’s always complaining she’s bored and has nothing to play with and then is fighting with ds over his toys so we explained whatever Santa leaves this year is to stay in our house so she has toys to play with but of course everything was put into bags and the baby voice started and the tears on because she wants them at mummy’s house and because mummy said she had to bring whatever there was home with her.

She fails on a regular basis to stick to our son's schedule despite numerous coversations - I have areived home at 6pm to find him still napping (made for a late night) and have also arrived home to find he hasn't napped at all (""he just wanted to keep playing!) He's 10 months old - I'm sorry, he doesn't get to decide! There have been other things regarding food, feeding, failing to buckle into highchair/stroller etc. but I just let it slide with a brief ""we don't do that because of x danger."" But fast forward to yesterday. I arrive at their house at what should have been the middle of his nap time with hopes of getting some work done, but nope - he's still up. No biggie I think, I'll just take him home to have him nap there. Then I notice the bandaid on his hand and the blood all over his legs, the couch, his toys.... - I asked what happened, and she laughs and said ""he cut it on the window! I didn't even know! And the little guy bled like a stuck pig!"" At first I'm confused, then realise she's referring to the broken plate glass window in their living room. We're taking huge shards of splintered glass. This thing has been broken for a couple of months now, and they haven't replaced it because they were waiting for things to thaw. Whatever, it's behind the couch and basically inaccessible. The problem here is now twofold (1) the window is behind the couch, which means he was placed on the couch and left unsupervised - dangerous on its own, but with a huge broken window behind it?? This could have been way more serious than it was. (2) she placed an adult sized bandaid on his finger, which he kept trying to eat. As we were leaving, she put on a new one (which I asked her not to because of a choking hazard) and guess what? I had to pull over on the side of the highway and pull it out of his mouth. I feel nuseous when I think about what could have happened if he had pushed harder on the glass, or if she had put him down for a nap with that bandaid he was determined to eat. Folks, what do I do? It's one thing to ignore a schedule, but to ignore obviously inherent situations? He could have killed himself about four different ways yesterday and it would have been negligence, not an unavoidable accident. How do I broach this?

 The month of February is [American Heart month](http://www.cdc.gov/features/heartmonth/) to spread awareness for Cardiovascular Disease, which is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. 

**February 7-14 is Congenital Heart Defect Awareness week.** 

Since we have some heart mom's and little heart warriors in the subreddit, here are some CHD facts to spread awareness! 

* Congenital Heart Defects are the most common birth defect affecting 1:110 or roughly 40,000 babies born in the U.S every year – and the leading cause of birth defect related deaths.
* An estimated 1:4 babies born with a heart defect has a critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). Babies with CCHD need surgery or other procedures in the first year of life. 
* Each year in the United States, approximately 4,000 babies (under one year old) will not live to celebrate their first birthday.
* There are approximately 35 different types of congenital heart defects.
* Some CHDs may be treated with surgery, medicine and/or devices, such as artificial valves and pacemakers. In the last 25 years, advances in the treatment of heart defects have enabled half a million U.S. children with serious CHDs to survive into adulthood.
* Early detection is critical! In the first 24 hours of life, a pulse oximetry (pulse ox) test can quickly and painlessly determine whether a baby has critical congenital heart disease and possibly save his or her life.

155,"He is almost 15 and I had to pull him from the final month of school last year for home schooling. He gets migraines that are largely anxiety/stress induced. (Some environmental triggers, but the stress ones happen a lot more when he is in school. Also there are things like the florescent lights at school.) Anyway, he is on anxiety medication and had been seeing a therapist. I don't know if they are helping enough. The school stress is mostly related to memories and stress that he can't let go (typical of the syndrome) based on some minor bullying issues (and kids being typical mean kids) and just being around those kids, even if nothing horrible is happening. School just started back up and he was absent the second day. Today is up in the air as well. 


Books and websites don't seem to offer specific strategies for dealing with these kinds of stress/fear/""trauma"" issues, or I am not finding the right stuff.

What do I do?! I don't have the time/energy to home school or send him to online school. I thought of changing school systems, but I am still looking for a place to live and can't afford to drive them to a nearby school system until we move (let alone I don't know where our place will be yet.)

158,"Hello /r/adoption. I am seeking advice on how to reach out to my first-father’s widow (who I will call “A’”). I am a late-discovery adoptee who learned I was adopted at 18. Late last year, I found my first-father’s obituary. He passed away seven years ago, the same year I learned I was adopted. 

In March, my mom helped me find the life-partner who was listed in his obituary. My mom and A talked a little back and forth, and my mom passed along my email address. A was so sweet and thoughtful and seemed enthusiastic. She said she would be in touch and would compile some photos of my dad for me. She even said that she had some of my dad’s things & his ashes and would happy to send them to me. (I don’t think it's my place to accept them?, but it meant so much that she offered.)

It’s been six months now, and I have not heard from her. 

I have A’s email address, and would like to reach out to her. It’s complicated though - I’m not actually related in any way to this person, by blood or by law, so she has even less reasons to want to help me than a relative would. It also appears that she did not know about me (she told my mom, “He’d be beyond stoked to know he had a daughter! That’s crazy fantastic to hear!”), and when my mom spoke with her, Mom didn’t explain that my dad did know about me. (I’m told he actually raised me and played with me and loved me for a year before his parental rights were terminated.)

I want to tread very lightly and gently - I know this person owes me nothing, and I don’t want to awaken any feelings of grief. I can’t imagine how much it must hurt to lose your life partner, and then have that person’s daughter come looking for you for answers almost a decade later. I don’t know if it would hurt her to know that my dad did know about me, and didn’t tell her. (Please note that I don’t judge my dad for not telling her - maybe he buried the grief, etc.)

Does anyone here have any advise on what to say? Should I write a longer message, explaining who I am and telling her a little about myself and a short list of questions? Should I write a very brief message, just checking in? She isn’t related to me and has no reason to help me. But she is the only person I am aware of who knew my dad, and probably the closest to him. I feel terrible for intruding on her life, and want to tread lightly.

-------

Here is what I have composed so far. Please let me know what you think.

*Hello A,*

*This is (my name), the daughter of the woman who reached out to you a few months back about (my dad’s name). I was hoping you might be willing to talk with me about your partner/my dad, (dad’s name).*

*I want to say that I am sorry to reach out - it’s been a while since you and my mom, (mom's name) talked, and I was worried maybe you had lost my contact information. I also want to say that it is very important to me to be respectful to what a strange situation this might be for you, and say that I am more than happy to go at whatever pace you are comfortable with.*

*Would you be okay with me asking some questions about (dad's name)? I can tell you about myself if you would like or if it would make you more comfortable.*

161,"Hello Gents, 

Tl;Dr: How can I help my wife stay motivated to keep working out like she wants to while morning sickness is keeping her down?

Something like 6 weeks along and morning sickness is kicking in pretty hard on her. She stayed home two days in the last two weeks because it was so bad. She's exhausted, I mean rightly so seeing as how she's growing a human, and doesn't want to work out but keeps stressing how she's bloated, gaining weight, and only wants to snack. 

I tried giving her workout tips in the moths leading up to us getting pregnant but she never took up any of them and now she's adding on some weight (plus bloating so that only makes it seem worse). I read thought that first time mom's tend to gain more than those on their second or beyond. 

Through AL this I've got to admit, I'm worn down from all her complaining. She's remaining adamant that she's not going to gain more than 25lbs... I can't workout for her and I've exhausted all the, ""let's go together,"" ""I'll make a plan for you,"" and etc. routes.  I honestly don't care how much she does or doesn't gain as long as they both stay healthy. Anyone had success in this arena?",True,sleeping
162,"Hello Parents, I'm hoping you can help me successfully take my 6 year old friend shopping for a special occasion dress and back to school. I'll preface this by saying, I love her to pieces but I'm not great with kids, I never know what to say and I'm super awkward. 

My husband's best friend is a single dad, his ex-wife is completely out of the picture and I volunteered to take his daughter shopping. 

I have bought her clothes since her mom left 3 years ago but usually I just buy a bunch of clothes and let her choose and take everything else back. She has started asking her dad to go to the mall and go shopping. Her dad is a great dad, he's been very conscientious about ""girl stuff"" but he's has been apprehensive to take her himself. They do go shopping but its usually like Target when shopping for other stuff, she never tries anything on and she does get a lot of hand-me-downs from friends. 

She told me her grandma takes her shopping at thrift stores, she pinched her nose and said she hates it and she wants to go real shopping. When I asked what real shopping was, she said shopping like she did with her mom at all the mall... she was 3 last time she saw her mom in person. I think she wants a stereotypical shopping experience like, we occasionally do what she calls ""girl time"" and get our nails painted or bake, which she absolutely loves. 

I was thinking of having a little talk before we leave about what to expect. I want this to be a fun experience but I want to make sure it goes smoothly and she has realistic expectations for this outing. 

* That she needs to listen to me. (She doesn't always listen to me. Any tips on what I can do to improve this?)
* That I will listen to her (if she is tired, hungry, needs to use the restroom, etc.), but she needs to tell me. 
* We will be honest with each other. 
* We will be polite to everyone, including sales people and each other. 
* We are shopping for dresses and clothes for school. 
* Her dad has some expectations about what we buy. She knows that I know her dad doesn't want her to have jellies, heels, makeup, etc.

I know to bring water, snacks, and hand wipes. She's not one of those kids who is always glued to a phone or ipad, but I suppose I could load some games on my phone just incase? She talks a lot. So I'm trying to think of things to ask her and be positive about, things I can remember to compliment/commend her on. 

I have a friend who works at a department store, who will stock a dressing room with stuff she might like in my price range so we will start there.  Depending on how we're doing after that, we could go to a few other stores at the mall and have lunch/snacks at a cafe I know she likes. I'm not expecting to a have a long day or get a lot done. I'd rather stop shopping then trying to get her to do something she is tired of or just not that into. 

I was thinking that if everything goes reasonably well and she is not exhausted we could have a reward after, I'd let her choose a ""girl time"" activity. 

Any suggestions? I might be overthinking this?",True,

Myself (29M) and my partner (32F) are now 13 weeks 5 days pregnant from the time this was posted. For information purposes we are both in Las Vegas NV and I work for a well known casino here. Also I apologize for this whole post jumping around and being random. I'm stressed. 

Now that we are in the second trimester my partner is finally mostly past her morning sickness and feeling like crap and basically looking like she might die, which is a good thing! She still gets slight nausea, but is able to keep food down a lot more and is a LOT more active which is awesome. During her time near the end of her first trimester I had two jobs lined up for her which she didn't feel well enough to do either (One working Front Desk, the other working in a Call Center, both for the same company I work for just different departments) so she never called back either manager.

Now that she's feeling better we are talking more and preparing more for our child, today after lunch my mother gave us some money because she wanted to pay for our Car Seat for the baby, so we went to Babies R Us since it's closing however we both noticed how expensive things were. Nice car seats were 120-300, Stroller combos were almost 400, cribs were 200-500, clothing, bottles, formula, all of this insanely expensive. I think it was a very large awakening for both of us and panic set in.

I'm the only one working in our household, we pay 969 a month rent, and basically after all bills we have 700$ left over. This is NOT including food for us, or anything for the baby yet. So obviously I'm worried... Especially once our child arrives I'll still be the only one working because I KNOW she will want to stay home with the baby, and she doesn't want me to work two jobs due to not seeing me and helping but... It's also not the 1950s anymore... Shit is far harder as I'm sure a lot of you know. I only make 16.70 an hour so I'm kinda freaking out, just right now she said she thinks she should start working but if she has an on call job wouldn't we lose our Medicaid? Also now that she says she thinks she should work she doesn't want to work for any of the guaranteed jobs I had lined up for her but wants to find work at something more ""ethical"" or that ""serves a higher purpose"" yet as far as I know there isn't ANYTHING like that in Vegas... So... Wtf?

Also we have NO idea what brands for baby stuff are to be trusted, I've tried looking and reading into stuff however there are SO many different opinions it all seems to contradict one another... I have no idea what the best car seat is, stroller, backpack... Thing? (diaper bag) or diapers, food, pacifiers, nothing, I feel so unprepared for this child and scared yet I try to put a brave face on for my partner because she's TERRIFIED that stuff isn't going to work out or that we will live in poverty... So I'm lost as hell.

The only people who know are very close family on my side and only her mother on hers... When I talk to her about telling people on hers she just says ""when the time is right"" but wouldn't you want to tell people sooner than later in order for them to be hyped up more or want to help more? Or... Idk. We are definitely going to have to have two separate baby showers just because all her side is in Washington and mine is down here and I don't even know where to begin with that or when to do it.

I’m hoping I can get some help here ... long story short, I want a baby! I’ve been trying to wait and go the old fashion route, where I meet the man of my dreams, get married and have kids. 

Unfortunately, I’ve yet to be that lucky. I’ve looked into adopting via adoption agencies, but the amount of money they’re asking to “buy” a baby is ridiculous (from my vantage point). I’ve also looked into going through the state; the process of that isn’t too bad but the kids they have available I wouldn’t be able to care for (some are disabled, others have faced traumatic events in their young lives, etc.). 

I want to be a mom to a newborn baby boy! I dream of this baby boy all the time; it brings so much joy to me. The amount of love I’d give him, how I’d fulfill all of his wants and needs, etc. 

If you’re reading this and have a new baby that you cannot care for (or know someone who does), for whatever reason, and want to give up parental rights by way of adoption, please let me know.

I struggled pretty badly with PPA, and was so worried about SIDS. Now that my PPA has passed and my daughter is older we have been bed sharing more and more. It started out only in the mornings and is sort of moving earlier and earlier. Also, we are being hit pretty hard by teething and my little one just wants to be close more. I would be fine bed sharing full time, but there are a few obstacles. I have moved my mattress to the floor and was feeling pretty comfortable. However, my DD is a very active sleeper and last night rolled off of the mattress in her sleep. Poor little thing woke up screaming and I think the fall scared her. I am not sure what to do to protect from this. I have pretty much moved everything out of our room like dressers and my clothes rack (our apartment doesn’t have closets sadly).  We have a crib that can turn into a toddler bed and I have thought about setting that up and making it flush with out mattress. 

What are your bedsharing setups? Do you use bed rails? Any tips, tricks, advice, or experience that you can share would be very much appreciated!

A little extra info:  my husband is away on business for the next few months so it is only me and DD in the bed. I am pretty aware of her when I sleep except when really exhausted and I try to put her in her crib on those nights for at least 3 or 4 hours. I don’t drink or smoke.

I am curious if anyone has had experience between these two forms of bc and what they would recommend...

Right now I don't have any hormonal contraceptives, only condoms. (Clarifier: I've never had an other form of birth control and only recently became sexually active). 

I don't want to take the pill. I tested positive for factor V Leiden and am not ""supposed"" to take any hormonal birth control. (But my aunt who I inherited it from was on the pill before she knew and it only became an issue when she had a surgery, so my mom and I are speculating that since I only inherited it from one side of the family and we will know about it in advance for any surgeries that my doctor may let me use a hormonal method.)

So pretending I can choose any method I want, I would rather it come down to an IUD and an arm implant. But for me both methods have pros and cons. 

The idea of an IUD and a doctor messing around down there makes me want to sew my legs shut, or transform into a boy. Even with my SO I will tense up really tight and have to relax myself before we can do anything.

I decided to write my first post on reddit regarding my Down Syndrome sister. First of all, I am not a native English speaker so please bear with my grammatically incorrect English. Second of all, I chose this subreddit to write my first post because I need help concerning her as I am in desperate need of support because of the lack of professionals present in the country I am living in. Okay, so she was born on 31/12/2008 which makes her 9 years old but she acts as a 5 yo because of her disorder. The problem is that she has developed this weird condition in which she likes to collect these different vertical items such as straws, plastic spoons and colored pencils. It was alright at first but it definitely drew some attention as she would carry them everywhere she goes in a big plastic cup or an open cylinder case, and whenever we went somewhere she would sit and look at them and put them together it gave her comfort somehow. She would literally never leave the house without them. But then it got more alarming, she started collecting sticks from the garden or even palm leaves that have really sharp ends. She cannot sleep without those collections by her side causing her to at least wake up four times a month with an infected eye. She sometimes even puts them in her mouth and I cannot understand why. I hope I wasn't too long for anyone who made it this far but I really need to understand this condition and how to minimize it (replacing stick or palm leaves with better safe vertical items has been used already with no luck) I would appreciate anybody's help regarding this or any recommendations for other sites that would help or listen or professionals that I could contact.",True,

I found this subreddit while frantically googling everything I could about having twins in the days since. There’s been a lot to digest so far, including potential bed rest, higher risk of complications and then of course, the major lifestyle change and huge economic impact headed our way. All of it has been a little overwhelming for both of us (I haven’t been able to sleep through the night since learning the news). 

My amazing wife, who ended up with preeclampsia just prior to delivering our son last time, has been really fatigued and really nauseous this time around. Coupled with her own stress about this pregnancy, the future, her career, finances, etc., it’s been a rough week. 

Just thought I’d drop an initial post to introduce our situation, say thanks to all the contributors in this subreddit (reading old posts on here has been quite helpful in taking the edge off, since it’s clear our situation has been mastered by others before us), and to say we will probably be posting more as we learn more (and have more pointed questions) throughout this pregnancy.

191,"Hello! I hope you are having a good day.

So, at the suggestion of some others here I picked up Oh Crap, we're on block 2.
Day 1, she peed in little drips on the potty and then mostly in her nap and night diapers. Day 2 she was a lot more eager to sit, sat a bunch but held her pee and towards the end of the day finally had a great big pee in the potty. She was super excited to dump it in the toilet and get to wash her hands. Day 3 i had a shirt on her and she again had just one great big pee. I almost had her convinced to poop in the potty that day, I could see she had to, but she ended up not being willing and pooped in the bath that night.

I checked the book and reread parts of it and decided as long as she is pooping somewhere and I know she isn't stopped up, I will try and let it go.

Because she had peed in the potty two days in a row and wasnt peeing on the floor (this whole time she only has once) I decided to move on to block 2 at day 4, yesterday. She woke up in a bad mood yesterday and refused any liquids all morning, did not pee in her nap diaper, finally took liquids in the afternoon and evening and still no pee in the potty. She didn't poop that day, the first day she hadn't pooped somewhere. All day she was super fussy and cried any time I brought up the potty, so i just tried not to push it on her. We had to do some driving around in the evening so we spread a diaper over the car seat, but left her commando.

Today, day 5, she is in a little better of a mood and has been willing to sit on the potty once, but is still not drinking much and still mostly crying about sitting on the potty. She is also again holding any pee or poop, no floor accidents, no wet pants, but no potty either.

Is this just resistance? Did I transition to pants too soon?

Also, I did what the book said and spent the first day (the first 3 days) just watching my daughter, no phone no tv no computers and I never found her pee dance. The best I could get was she would sometimes",True,sinle parents

My wife and I have a 7 week old son. He has been formula fed since the very beginning but we keep having issues. And we do have his two month appointment coming up so we will be discussing with our doctor but we are puzzled. Looking to see if anyone has had any similiar experiences. 

We started him on the Similac Pro-Advance. He had A LOT of trouble with gas. Constantly fussy because of it. He seemed miserable. We switched to Pro-Total Comfort. This helped with the gas some but his stools started becoming almost solid. I mean chunkier and harder than peanut butter. It was almost the consistency of clay. Once again, miserable. We called the doctor and she recommended 2-4oz. of prune juice. This worked fairly well. We figured it must be a formula issue so for the last 11 days, we have been using Gerber SoothePro. He is NEVER gassy on this one but the poop issue continues. He will turn red, push, strain, cry, etc. We have used prune juice, stomach massages, rowing his legs, and more! We eventually get him to poop but the consistency is still almost clay like and it takes hours to get him to poop. He hasn't pooped without some sort of assistance in a few weeks. I understand he's still learning how to work everything and where to push but the consistency is concerning. There has to be a solution!

Quick Recap
Pro-Advance: Miserably gassy
Pro-Total Comfort: Less gassy, clay like poop
SoothePro: No gas issues, still clay like poop

210,"Hey everyone!

So a thought crossed my mind today. I am having a kid in July (our first) and we are pretty sure we are going to stop at one.

Reasons for this are varied, finances being one of them and 2nd biggest of all, hoping its going to be easier on us. Happier, less stressed parents with more free time may equal more energy and happiness for the kid, etc. (That's just personally how we think- others may be energized by or love a big family and that's great! But we are both pretty introverted and thrive on quiet and down time)

I'm nervous about the impending difficulties of parenthood, I will be honest. Many parents talk about how exhausting the work is, if it isn't a screaming newborn, a toddler into everything, diapers, bathtime, bedtime, soccer practice, screen time, homework, friends, are they drinking or smoking? Etc. 

I'm hoping to get some anecdotal evidence from you all because I don't really have a frame of reference (most people I've asked have 2, 3, 4 kids and talk about how difficult and exhausting it can be most days). How much easier is it to raise an only child? I'd imagine that raising 2, 3, 4+ would be, well, 2, 3, 4+ times as difficult overall because there are multiple bedtimes, teen mischief to worry about, activities to drive to, kids to drop off, conflicts to resolve, etc.

Could it be said that parents of an only get more free time as well?

I am an only child myself and as I got to be self sufficient we had family dinners, but my parents pretty much went off to do their own thing in the eve and we'd schedule a fun family date for the weekend, or maybe a family game night one evening a week. Otherwise I'd just run around outside, play video games, watch TV or read. I REALLY  enjoyed this model as a kid, and now that the tables are turned I think I'd enjoy this as a parent too.

216,"Hey guys
My Second LO was born 2/22 via urgent Csection (labored with pitocin and epidural for 24 hours, failure to descend and had blood in urine). She was 7lbs3oz, totally perfect.

 Despite my best efforts I couldn't EBF  (PCOS, suspected IGT) and completely stopped combo feeding about a week ago. We gave her Enfamil Infant first, then switched to Newborn when we got home,  then in her 3rd week we switched her to Gentlease. Since her 2nd or 3rd week she's had green poops. They aren't frothy or mucousy or anything, pretty much the same consistency as normal poop. They are off and on. Sometimes yellow sometimes green.

However at her 1 month on Thursday I told her doctor that she was still having green poops, and they did an occult blood test which came out positive.

So now I'm freaking out. There are no allergies on either side of the family. My ODD was also formula fed bc of the same issues and was 5lbs8oz at birth. She's 2.5 and still on the small side but smart and wild and healthy. This one  was 9lbs4.5oz at her one month (actually 5 week) appt. She's relatively calm, doesn't spit up much. Wakes up 2x a night but sleeps well. She does have a lot of farts and a facial rash that is very slowly going away but going away all the same. She drinks 4oz every 2.5-3 hours like a champ.

221,"Hey guys....first day on reddit. I posted this on the atheism subreddit and someone told me to cross post it here....not sure if there is a better way to crosspost other than copy/paste so I apologize if there is. Original post below

Hey everyone, new to reddit
A little about me....Grew up in the South with an extremely Baptist family. Growing up even mentioning that you had any doubts in the bible was trouble. Now I am the single mother to an awesome 7th grader named Sara. Sara is everything I was not as a child....shy, super smart straight A student, Kind, aka not a complete asshole like I was at that age. I have never pushed religion (or lack thereof) on her.....we don't really talk about it, there have been times when she has asked a question that I have answered to the best of my ability. She has gone to a friends church a few times and told me ""she had a great time but that she didn't really believe in it too much""
I had to pull her out of school today bruised and bloody. She is terrified to go back to school. She told me that she had been teased for a while because she mentioned she didn't believe in god (we are still in the South btw) She told me that now she thinks she was wrong, and that this was "" Gods punishment""....hearing that makes me madder than anything in this world. I have talked to a few teachers and the principal about the situation and they have not been able to help....I am probably going to end up pulling her out of this school.
Being a parent is tough.....financially I don't know what to do, between the medical bills.....the potentially having to miss some work to stay with her from school.....they severely damaged her Clarinet that she uses for band by smashing it on the pavement. What hurts the most is that this strong willed kid is absolutely defeated and broken......questioning her beliefs because of pressure and fear. I wish I could go kungfu mommy on all these little assholes.

222,"Hey ladies! So we started sleep training last Monday (it's been 1.5 weeks). We read The Sleepeasy Solution and it's worked great for nighttime sleep! Our daughter is a little over 4 months and is now putting herself down for bed every night and waking for one early morning (3am ish) feeding. It's great!! We don't spend forever getting her to sleep then tip toe out of the room worried that we will wake her. 
The problem is nap time. She was doing ok with naps in the beginning but now seems to be totally resisting them all together. She will not put herself down and we end up resorting to old methods just to get her some sleep. Book says babies this age should get 3-4hrs of naps a day. 
We are putting her down for naps not on an exact schedule but are shooting for: 
Nap1 - 1.5hrs after she wakes for the day. 
Nap 2 - 2 hrs after waking from nap 1
Nap 3 - 2 hrs after waking from nap 2 
Then bedtime 1-1.5hrs after nap 3. 
What do I do to help her nap better?!  Her cues are very subtle so we use the 2hr window to help us know when to put her down. If we wait much longer than 2 hrs she seems overtired - rubbing her red eyes and getting cranky.

223,"Hey there!

A few months ago I met a wonderful man. He is young (21), as am I (23). We get along very well, and we recently moved into a home together. Our lives are working out beautifully, and our communication seems to be very efficient. He has a 5-month-old son that I have fallen in love with--though I would never have imagined bringing a baby into my life before I met my boyfriend! 

Although most things seem to be going pretty smoothly, there have been some challenges that have surfaced, primarily involving my stepson's birth mother. She didn't want to have the baby to begin with, even threatening to kill him before he was born; my boyfriend fought to keep his son himself and prevent him from being put up for adoption (the baby's mother broke up with my boyfriend just a couple weeks after she became pregnant).

For the first four months of the baby's life, the BM had nothing to do with him at all. We heard nothing from her whatsoever, though she and my boyfriend have joint custody. But a couple of weeks ago she appeared out of nowhere and is trying to become involved with the baby's life. My boyfriend doesn't really have a choice but to let her see her son since he doesn't have sole custody and doesn't have the funds to take her to court for it. So, at least for the time being, she's directly involved with our new little family. I respect her role as the baby's biological mother, but it sometimes makes me feel like the ""fourth wheel"" to what would have been my boyfriend's family. I sometimes feel like I'm ""just the girlfriend""--I make the bottles, change the diapers and wash the clothes, but I don't really have a role beyond that. My bf has to be in contact with the BM in order to arrange for visits and whatnot, but he is attempting to be friends with her because she asked to be friends again. She knows about me but has expressed regret for not staying with my bf and ""having a complete family."" He says he isn't interested in being with her again, but at the same time he can't make her go away, so he might as well be friendly with her. Sigh. I feel like chopped liver, but there's not much I can do!

229,"Hi

So i am currently an assitant trainer, for our special needs team, where we mostly have kids with severe ADHD and a range of autism.

I really love helping these kids, but i am having a hard time figuring out how to best help our DS woman. She is 28, and she is just a bundle of joy, but obviously, training her in a martial art is not easy, at all.

We are pretty lucky, that we are a lot of volunteer trainers in our club. And some times we are as many trainers, as there are students.
This means that we will often each do personal training with 1 or 2 students at the time, and we really have the time to focus on the individuals.

I usually end up with training her, and another girl, and they are always happy when they get assigned to me, so there are no problems with her disliking me at all. (And she doesn't shy away from telling us if she is dissatisfied, she once walked up to our main trainer, slapped him on the wrist and yelled ""SLOW DOWN"").

**So, on to where i really need help:**

We usually train something called Poomse, which is basically a series of simple moves (most people know them as Kata's, which is the name for it in Karate).

But i am having a really hard time getting her attention. Dont worry, i know that it is very normal for someone with DS.

I need to know how far i can ""push"" her, without being unfair to her.

When we are doing the poomse, she is supposed to be looking at the way i do it, and imitate the movements. However, she gets distracted almost instantly, and she loses focus between each move. She is often distracted by the other groups, training at higher level. I try calling her name, but she is so distracted that i often have to stand in front of her, blocking whatever she is looking at, before she focus on me. 

Unfortunately, we do not have more than 1 room, so it is not possible for me to train them where there are no distractions. (also, i am obviously not allowed to be alone with them, as the other girl is a minor, and we have very strict rules in this regard)

I have sometimes tried clapping my hands, and called her name loud, and it sometimes work, but not very often.

Should i just accept that this is the best she can do, or should i try being more ""stern"" with her, so that she can actually learn something?

Do any of you have some tips, so i can find the middle road, between being too hard, and being too soft?

Thanks in advance :)",True,

I'm a new poster to this subreddit, but I thought this was the best place to ask (please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Brand new to reddit. Needed an outlet, someone to talk to. My fiancé and I are beginning to plan our lives together. Everything is great except for one glaring issue.. 

I am an atheist and proud, She a believer in god, doesn't believe in dinosaurs or cavemen (Which needless to say I find absurd). Most of these ideas come directly from her thick headed father…

So my Daughter (6yo) had her first sleepover last night at her friend's house.

My daughter is just like any other 6 year old really. A little bugger at times, cheeky backchat, doesn't eat her veggies etc. But shes also very kind and caring and loving and intelligent. Very intelligent. Shes well behaved most of the time except from the occasional temper tantrums. For context, my daughters Mum isn't around and hasn't been since she was around 4 months old. I have a good job, good prospects, I earn good money. I own my own home and handle things myself. I have a steady girlfriend (4 years) but she doesn't live with us. As you continue reading please consider if the lack of a mother figure could be an issue.

Last night during said sleepover shes not only accidentally killed her friends Guinea pig by being too rough but bullied another little girl who was there for the sleepover.

Hearing the friends mother describe her behaviour I was in utter disbelief. I was mortified. And very very angry. But mostly hurt and embarrassed.

It seems so uncharacteristic of her to act in this way and for the first time in my 6 years of being a father I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed and embarrassed and I have no idea how to handle this. The accident with the Guinea pig I can understand a little bit. Shes not used to being around pets as we don't have any so she may have got overly excited and handled it too rough. I strongly believe it wasnt intentional. If it were intentional then that's even more worries in itself. You hear about children hurting animals going on to become serial killers. Oh god..

And the bullying! How could she do that? I believed I had raised her better. I believed I'd done a better job. I was bullied myself so I know how it feels and I thought I had strongly driven it into her how wrong bullying was. I feel so guilty and upset I've nearly been in tears for most of the day. I'm so appalled by her behaviour.

I'm looking back through 6 years of parenting wondering where I've gone wrong or what I could have done better and what to do from here.

So please has anyone else had a similar experience and can please just push me in the right direction? I've done the usual. No treats. No swim club. No iPad time. No TV time. Shes still in her bedroom reading books.

Basically the title...I have 2 boys, ages 6.5 and very nearly 10. Like any kids they love screens and when it’s playtime they’d go for their Xbox or a tablet every time if it were up to them, especially the older one. They do get time for that but it’s pretty limited (thanks parental controls) and when their time runs out, or if they’re already out of time when we say “find something to do, go play,” more and more often I’m hearing that there’s nothing else for them to do. 

Let me say - I am totally a believer in not solving this for them, not rescuing them from boredom, I know that coming up with something to do on their own is important, i am aware of the pitfalls of instant gratification and the benefits of struggling and problem solving, I use the “either find something to do or I can easily give you a chore” approach regularly, etc. 

Having said that, I feel like having toys/activities available to choose from that are age/level-appropriate seems pretty normal and I do think they’ve outgrown many of the things we have in the house, so it made me want to ask...

For those who have or know kids this age, what kinds of toys/activities do you see them reach for when screens or playing outside aren’t an option?

My best friend and I are currently researching his adoption and family lineage. We were provided with his medical records and a letter from his birth mother. 

In the letter, bio mom lists many names and last names in an extensive family history. She invites friend, son, to look for her one day but that she will understand if he doesn't. 

The last names in the letter have all been redacted, crossed out completely. Who would have done this? Would social work cross out last names if bio mom had been okay with an open adoption?

Do your boobs ever get used to (for lack of a better term) pumping on a regular basis and stop producing as much or is it just a supply issue?  I currently pump 3 times a day while at work and am in the process of trying to up my supply (mother's milk tea, oatmeal, and just added another pumping session at night) I also just changed my membranes but I feel like I am just not getting what I used to.

243,"Hi all!
I’m childless myself, but one of my best friends has twin 16 month olds and a three year old. Everyone in her household (except, miraculously, her) has been sick with different colds/flus since September.
She and I have been trying to get out together for a few weeks to give her a bit of a break and had plans to go out tonight but she just texted that all three kids are sick again and she’s not sure she wants to leave her brother in law to take care of them all.

ANYWAYS, I try to go over and help her out as much as possible. Her husband has had bronchitis for months, so he’s doing his best to help out but the majority of burden (like it is with most mom’s, I think) to care for everyone is on her.

SO in lieu of going out tonight, I thought I’d try to maybe put together some kind of gift basket for her. Maybe with some stuff for the kids, but also with things for her to try to give her a little me time.

So I’m looking to you for suggestions! If your best friend dropped off the perfect gift basket as a pick-me-up for you, what would be in it?",True,

246,"Hi all,

More not so great news this week.

We've been having growth scans ever since we had an abnormal quad screen. We did a non-invasive test and ruled out downs and any chromosomal abnormalities but the doctor still wanted to do monthly growth scans in case there was a placental insufficiency.

Good thing they did. I give the doctor some mad props for that. Out last scan (before this week) was at 24W. The kiddo was doing great 40-50th percentile in everything except his stomach which was upper 30's. No cause for alarm.

Tuesday we had another scan this week, again most things were upper 30's to low 50's, but his stomach was a tiny 3% compared to what they like to see.

My heart sank. The pretty quickly diagnosed is with IUGR meaning the placenta isn't working great. They through us through dozens of more tests and my wife was also diagnosed with Mild-Preeclampsia. There is no high blood pressure indicators or any of the other signs but the protein during a 24 hour urine test was high, so they went ahead with the diagnosis so they could watch it more closely.

The doctor's goal is for us to hold the baby inside until week 34 (6 weeks from Tuesday). Which is amazing and at the same time super scary. 

Starting next week my wife will be starting short term disability at work (they've arranged for her to work a few hours from home daily but only clerical computer work). We have 3-4 appointments per week from here on out and I am freaking out.

From how the doctor described it they are watching closely because right now it's best for the baby to stay inside. It's still growing (although slowly) and getting some nutrients from the placenta. At some point they can provide better care in the NICU so they just want to catch the right time for when that happens.

Obviously we are freaking out a bit. What happens if the baby needs help in between appointments and we don't know. So many questions swirling it's just a sink of not fun.

Has anyone else gone through the IUGR diagnosis. Any idea of what to expect. I like to hope things can only get better but I don't know what to think with everything having come in yesterday and today.",True,sleeping
247,"Hi all,

long story short our 4 month vaccinations were delayed a month as she was unwell at the time, getting three injections at this sitting.  In the days prior she had got into a good routine of only waking once or at most twice a night after a long period of being very difficult.

Unfortunately it seems these have knocked her for six, we managed the fever in the two days after but since then she HATES sleep, like seems to actually fear it or potentially have bad dreams?  She's exhausted but will cry like a maniac for an extended period of time if you try to put her down.  If miracles behold and she falls asleep, she will jolt awake in around 15mins.

We were hoping this was a short term setback but has been going on for a week now so I'm a little concerned.  Plus very frustrated that we seemed to get to a decent point and now we're going backwards :(

Just wondering if anyone else experienced the same and found any ways to get things on track again?

Didn't get a full period, like clots and red blood since then. Every three months or so I would experience the oh so lovely brown blood, that lasted about 3-5 days, but never enough for me to even use a pad or tampon. I read up about it on this subreddit and never worried. 

Anyways, about a week and a half ago I started to get that lovely brown blood, but it hasn't ended, and more puzzling, has become almost the redder, clottier period blood I used to get before the implant.

256,"Hi all. 
First time poster on this sub, and on mobile. We follow attachment parenting, did blw, baby signing, and extended breastfeeding.

We have a 20 month old (almost 21) and are due with another in less than 14 weeks.  She has been night weaned since 15 months and completely weaned at 18 months. She bedshared from 4 months to 16 months, and still as needed (bad allergy days, teething, nightmares).  We have a good routine of bath, pjs, teeth, stories, prayers, songs and rocking to sleep. 

She takes a 1 to 2 hour nap around noon (after lunch) each day. It takes 10 to 15 mins for her to go down. Averages 90 mins asleep. We also try to get her to the playground for 30 to 45 mins each day. On cold or rainy days, we try to find an indoor playplace (She signs play at chick fil a now). 

Up until about 2 weeks ago, LO 1 was doing great sleeping in her own bed most nights through the night. She did, and still does, wake between 7 and 8 each morning.

 She stayed at my just yes parents overnight when we went to SO's company party. We are trying to have her stay once a month to get used to it before LO2 arrives and she stays for 2 nights. While there, she stayed up until around 1130, (normally asleep by 8/830 with routine starting by 730). She ended up bed sharing with my parents rather than sleep on her bed there. Her great grandma was also in the room, so I'm not surprised. Since then, she won't go to sleep before 9 most nights and she's woken up every night and come into our bed. Most nights are between 2 and 4 am,  but it's been as early as 11pm. I bought and started reading the No Cry Sleep Solution For Toddlers and Preschoolers, but it's been misplaced in the holiday cleanup. 

We need her back in her room before April. She's in a toddler bed since I can't lean over a crib side easily. Her coming to our bed bothers SO more than me, but LO1 will be holding on to him and pet his arm for a long time in her sleep. It drives him nuts. I have my back to her because pregnancy left side sleeping.

Great ideas/suggestions/advice with every click it seems!

I am devouring books from Dawkins, Hitchens, Dennett, Harris, etc...  However, this post is supposed to be about my kids so here it is:
I explained to my 7 year old son a bit about god (Christian) because he was saying ""oh my god"" a ton so I wanted him to be aware of what he was saying when around others and how it might be offensive.  Now he's moved onto the son, and saying ""Jesus"" while playing video games.  Long story short he doesn't know who this Jesus is, yet.  I don't want the trinity to happen so before he gets to yelling ""oh holy ghost!"" I want to let his sponge-y brain learn about the myths and legends from around the globe and history.

I've created a private Facebook group for all of those who have siblings with Down Syndrome. The group is for siblings to share their experiences growing up with their brother(s) and/or sister(s) who were born with Down Syndrome. We laugh together, support each other when we have questions, celebrate together and lift each other up during times of struggle. 

Please make sure that if you'd like to join (or will be referring a friend or one of your children) that you answer the 2 qualifying questions when sending your request to join (it will automatically prompt the questions when you click join, but for some reason I can't make it mandatory, so a lot of people haven't been filling it out). I placed these questions because I want to make sure this is a safe/resourceful environment specifically for siblings. This is my way of filtering through people who don't meet the criteria.

Wouldn’t do homework , wouldn’t study at all even though she is capable of. My sister has tried to make her study by setting up a study area at home setting timings for homework. Sitting with her but all she says is “ I dont want to study. I hate studying I hate school I hate homework” constant lack of concentration. Twin A said there was no problem at school and she herself is very focused.

280,"Hi friends! I have a EBF 14-week-old until today. For the past 6 weeks or so she’s been fussy at the breast and also fussy with pumped milk in the bottle. She arches her back and screams during and after the feed. It’s so stressful. And I’m not getting much help from my pediatrician because they’re so slammed with COVID madness.

Anyways, I was about to do a feed today and she just would not latch. She just screamed. I had some BM stashed but I just really didn’t feel like defrosting it at that point. So I gave her some formula — I had some enfamil gentlease on hand. Girl sucked it down (still screamed during) but didn’t arch her back or take forever to calm down afterward. She seems oddly ... happier?? GEEZ!

This feels like such a mental load off. I kind of want to experiment with it more to see how she does but ugh pumping suuuucks and I don’t really want to do it anymore.

I'm flying back home to the UK (from germany) on Monday and have an exam on tuesday which will keep me out all day.

He's had expressed milk from the bottle no problem and he's a greedy little guy but should we buy a few different brands/types of formula just in case?

I'm therefore particularly interested in comparing empathy levels between children with, and without, Autism. If you're interested please follow the link for more information. Happy to follow this up with results if there's interest.

I'm a young mom (early 20s) who has been ridiculed by my family for not breastfeeding. I got off of my medication (wellbutrin and ativan) when I became pregnant,  and quit cold turkey by choice at 4 weeks pregnant.  It has been hellish, but my baby is perfectly healthy in my tummy and that's what matters for now.  My depression and anxiety have spiraled into something dark and nasty, and Im getting back on my medication immediately post partum,  because it worked well for me and I'm at a high risk for PPD (although I don't know if that's the proper term for it considering it's been constant depression for a decade now,  and not really related to my pregnancy).

 Of course,  I can't breastfeed on these medications, but I have been through countless ssris and wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that helps me stay motivated alert ect. My family has been saying things like my kid will be obese, stupid,  have asthma, and I should just get over it and be a good mom who doesn't need pills.... Seriously.  I can't even get out of bed,  have gained close to 70 lbs,  and.... Yeah.  I can't be a good mom in this state.  I know I don't have to excuse myself,  I just wanted to give a little background I suppose. 

My son is due in 2 weeks.  
I have 3 pura kiki stainless steel bottles (they're pretty expensive,  but I like the idea of them so I got 3) , and one glass bottle.  I'm curious as to if this will be enough, or how many bottles people normally have. I feel like it's a small amount, but the other part of me doesn't want a million unwashed bottles around (we live with my in laws,  and they're.... Weird about anything we own being visible in their kitchen / anywhere but my bedroom). having just a few will help me keep on top of cleaning / drying them right away.  I don't know.  I have no idea what I'm doing at all,  and I'm just looking for some anecdotes I guess.

I am 43 year old man, happily married with two sons, my eldest is 14 nearly 15. He had a girlfriend when he was 11 and while he was quite happy with her something always seemed amiss. I remember one time they kissed and he kind of pulled away like something was bothering him and he just told her to forget about it. 

Eventually they broke up and he’s spent the last 2 and a half years outside of a relationship. It seems like he’s never really been bothered by it which is good. However recently he’s slowly been starting to change in the way he acts.

When he goes swimming he becomes super excited and happy, he’s in an all boys squad for his school, and I occasionally notice his eyes wandering when I’m watching from the side. He’s also suddenly started wearing skinny jeans, he hated skinny jeans before but now he loves them, I once saw him checking himself out in the mirror looking at what he looked like from the back. Sometimes he also walks kinda feminine I don’t know if that’s just my opinion or if he does it subconsciously.

Suddenly he’s become massively popular at school. From what I can tell I think he may have come out to his friends and one of them told people at his school. He told me he had an argument with one of his friends and he appeared kind of upset about it but it sounds like all his friends have all sides with him.

I was just wondering what others schedules/systems are in hopes of better streamlining my own. At the moment I am pumping at night after Little Bug goes to bed and can only produce about 2 oz. Little Bug has been sleeping through the night starting at 10pm and waking around 7am. During the day I feed on demand but will not let her go beyond 2 hours between feedings. This is mainly due to her doctor expressing a little concern at her 2 month checkup with regards to her weight gain. She didn't lose weight but she averaged around 14 oz a week while the doctor said she would like her to be around 20-25 oz a week.

I figured I would start pumping a little after each feeding but I'm a little inundated with the cleaning that is required. It's not that big of a deal but it is a little time consuming. After each pumping session I break down the pump and clean in hot water with soap. At the end of the day I sterilize. Rinse, lather, repeat.

Some things you only get one shot at.  


Now I feel the kids are just the debris of that broken dream. Single parenting is closer to a nightmare than a dream. I don't enjoy it a second. No upside. I don't laugh with them. No play. I just survive. I don't spend a second thinking about them when they're with their mom. (We do a 50/50 split). I honestly think I could be away from them for 6 months without missing them for a single second. I don't really connect with them or share these small special moments. It's just pure business and chores.

It's quite scary realizing that I'm burned out and parenting lost all emotional involvement on my part. I wish you could have seen me. I was a good father. The best.

How do I get that back? Or should I accept that I've given it all I had and let them stay with their mom more - maybe a 80/20 split or less? They're good kids, they deserve to be around people who love them, and I fear my source is spent and it's not coming back.",True,

344,"I don't know if this is the right place for this, maybe I should shuffle on over to /r/offmychest...  But here it goes.

I have two, beautiful, healthy, young children.  I'm a stay at home mom to a 33 month old boy and a 5.5 month old girl.  Our last year has been tough and stressful - I had a difficult pregnancy, and we sold our house and moved to a new area.  We've been in our new house for 3 weeks and we're adjusting to living very close to family.

My mother is an occupational therapist who works with pre-school and school aged children in schools and my MIL is a pre-school teacher.  It's not like I don't have resources and people who care. 

When my son went to his 2 year Dr. appointment they said that I should come back at 2.5 if he wasn't ""talking more"".  But at 2.5 he WAS talking ""more"", and there was so much else going on that I didn't make time to go back specifically for him.  Additionally, all along my mother has said that he's doing GREAT - not just ""okay"" or ""fine"", but ""GREAT"".  She's always extremely impressed with him and constantly picking her jaw up off the floor after he shows off yet another skill.  

When I took my newborn in for her 3 month visit, I inquired with the pediatrician about my son.  I told her he still wasn't talking conversationally... that he was certainly talking MORE.... But.... 

The pediatrician referred me to early intervention.  Between my mother and my MIL, I am no stranger to early intervention and I'm aware that it's a great resource.  But we were 3 weeks away from moving!  So I waited till we moved into our new house to call local early intervention services.  They arranged a visit and it took another 3 weeks for the evaluation to actually take place.

It took place this morning.

Allow me to give you the following background:  He knows his alphabet cold (in order, and out of order), he knows the phonics sounds, he knows how to write all the letters, and he can read a significant number of words.  He can write all his numbers, count objects, and count (by himself) to 100.  He knows his colors, his shapes (including rhombus, pentagon, hexagon and octagon).  He knows animals and their sounds.  He's sweet and he's affectionate.  He just doesn't converse with me.

The early intervention people were lovely.  They were kind and clear and helpful.  The evaluation went okay I guess, but it was clear he failed a number of things on the standardized test that I know he can do -- but it wasn't a surprise to me that he ignored requests or refused to do things when asked.  He always has his own agenda. 

Basically he's delayed.  Significantly delayed.  Socially delayed. Enough so that he easily qualifies for early intervention services and therapies.  Speech and general Teacher therapy.  I leaped at the offer of help and he should start treatment in less than 14 days.  We're going to get him to work on back and forth interaction. 

But I'm a fucking mess. I feel like curling into a fetal ball in a corner somewhere and bawling for hours.  I've started a couple of times, but if I really let it go, I'm not sure I could calm myself down. 

I know my mom is going to call me later on today to find out how it went.  I know my MIL is going to stop by on her way home from pre-school to talk to me about how it went.  A friend of mine has already IMed me 10 minutes ago to ask how it went.

I don't want to talk about it.  I feel like a failure.  I feel like this has got to be my fault.  

I will fucking take care of this, you know? I will seek out and accept help and  I will work on it.  I will woman the fuck up and address this as head on as I am capable.

It worked really well for us and I was elated to be back at work. I loved the interaction, feeling valued at work, having time to eat my lunch, being able to run an errand on the way home from work, etc. We had a lot of illnesses over the winter (RSV, HFM, ear infections, etc.), and while that was exhausting, I knew that is par for the course with daycare and it didn't really phase me.

However, lately I'm feeling frustrated with daycare- just the fact that my babies don't have as much time outside, are given way more ""junk"" snacks than we give at home, etc. Naturally, daycare does things differently than how I would do things and this hasn't bothered me previously, but it has been bothering me lately.

I approached my boss about changing my schedule a bit and to my surprise, he was very accommodating and supportive. I now work in the office 11-5/5:30 and at home from 7-9ish at night. This allows me to have mornings to hang out with the babies, do some cleaning around the house, or go for a run. I am SO grateful that I have such a supportive work environment. However, lately, I'm just feeling so burned out. Even with my new schedule, there's always so much to juggle and I definitely have the guilt of not spending more time with my babies.

We had a nanny start about 4 weeks ago so that the baby could bond with her, and be comfortable with her.

Speaking of her mother, she is a drug addict. She has six children and has custody of none of them. About a year ago she gave birth to yet another drug addicted baby and CPS took all six of her kids. I hired a lawyer and proved that she had been living with me all this time and she was placed in my care. Her case was closed within months. Three of her siblings were placed with their grandmother (who actually has no relation to the children but helped raise their bio mom) and the other two with their father. Her grandmother made it clear that she wanted custody of her and that she would be better off living with her. Which is funny to me because not only does my daughter not even know her, her grandmother hasn't seen her in years. She hasn't called to ask about her or anything. All of a sudden that these kids bring in money and she cares about them (I believe she gets $1,200 a month for the three she has). 

Anyway, a while ago I decided I wanted to adopt her. I spoke to her bio mom (my sister) about it and she agreed and even asked why I didn't do this sooner. I paid over $1,000 for a home study, got a mental and physical examination, and basically proved to the court that my fiancé and I are responsible and financially able to support her. I adopted my daughter in February of this year.

Sorry I'm rambling. But the point is, whenever I bring her around her family and they hear her calling me mom they correct her and tell her that I'm her aunt. They also tell her that my two year old is not her sister. I've explained to my daughter the whole situation and she understands that she didn't come from my belly like her sister did, she came from someone else's. But it pisses me off that they tell her these things. I feel like they're trying to put her against me like I somehow did her wrong. They don't seem to realize that I saved her from years of abuse and neglect that her siblings went through (I made many CPS reports and all 7 cases got closed without them ever doing anything). They don't realize that she never had to recover from the issues her bio siblings are dealing with now. I don't even know what to do at this point.

However, we have had to talk to my 6 year old daughter about my illness and she has asked will I die. I answered her as sensitively as I could without telling a barefaced lie. I said I didn’t think that I would die and I am hoping to get better, but that yes I might well die. 

She cried a bit and then, naturally, asked ‘what happens when you die?’ My wife has already had discussions like this with her where she talked about how our body becomes part of the world/universe again.

The last three years it all has constantly been a rollercoaster with the ex and his up and downs with the downs becoming more frequent and more severe.


I will not post all the details of why but it has to happen. I work full time from a home office. So I appear to my child to always be on the computer, this worries me too.

also how to I keep him from feeling like I am always on the computer too. I have to work to make ends meet, more than ever now that I am full custody and functioning on one income.

393,"I have literally not been around a child learning to read since I was 16 years old, and I definitely did not pay any attention to it at that age. I'm just really confused regarding exactly HOW other people teach their children to read. What actually works?

I have a 6 year old (7 in June) in first grade. He has never been in public school. Teaching him how to read has been ... Not easy. I've tried phonics, which was probably the most successful at actually getting him started.. He knows all of the phonics rules and he's great at sounding out words that use those rules. 

But he's really lacking in the sight word area.. And in fluency in general. He has issues remembering sight words. And while he's reading, he will stop and sound out every flipping word. Like ""has"" which he has read 1,000 times so far. He still stops and sounds it out even though he should know it on sight. He will stop and say h-a-s, has. Which obviously hinders reading fluency. I've told him that if he knows the word, he doesn't need to sound it out. But he acts as if he has to sound it out.

Also with other words he has read previously in the same lesson, he often won't remember them when they are repeated. He also has a bad habit of  guessing at words. Often when reading a sentence, he will read the words correctly the first time, and then at the end we read the sentence again (more fluently), and he will guess at the words and read them incorrectly (likely because he's just trying to repeat from memory without actually paying attention to the words that he's reading because he just wants to finish and do other things). 

He also just hates his lessons in general. And sometimes I feel like he misreads words on purpose just to fish for an answer from me. He can't read independently at all. I'm pretty sure he's behind, and I want to fix that.

I'd just like something simple that I can implement to get out of this rocky place that we're in and get him to actually read words on sight with fluency and catch up to where he should be.

Just a note - I don't want to drop money on a program. I'm not interested in buying curriculum, workbooks, or anything else. I'm not looking for product suggestions.

Was it because it's was only like a week and a half after he was born and my milk is still catching up to what he eats?

I was previously only breastfeeding twice a day and then pumping 7 times (I was doing 8, but had to cut down due to exhaustion). I'm having to supplement due to a low supply of milk. Yesterday I went to a private LC to talk to about my supply, we did a weighted feed and my baby only got 1.8oz total from both breasts (she told me 2oz, but every milliliter counts) she said my baby could get more and told me I was going great and supply was good, that my baby was tired, she was right, this time. She was fussy for the next 2 hours, she had to be burped and was tired, that's fine. Today I tried to follow her advice, to primarily breastfeed and pump after when baby was sleeping, and today I realized why I had to supplement. I breastfeed her for about 20 minutes, then let her nurse to sleep twice. She woke up 20 minutes later while I was pumping, fussing for an hour until I realized she was hungry. She was starving. I gave her a 3oz bottle and she drank it so fast, it just solidified that my supply wasn't up to par with her. I was told to breastfeed, supplement as needed and then pump, I've tried that already and was told on a previous post to drop one because I am exhausted. I felt as if I was doing better by her by just pumping, even though I know she gets more out of me, but not knowing how much she's getting is anxiety inducing and being home alone trying to breastfeed only for her to wake up screaming 20 minutes later, knowing I'll have to pump, it's exhausting. I just want to pump, probably breastfeed at least twice a day, until I can see my supply is actually rising so I dont have to scramble to supplement. I know I should have a bottle ready, I know that, I normally do, but it's also nice being able to hand her over to my husband or MIL for a feeding.

399,"I have to vent. I am absolutely incensed. My (baptist) mom has been getting more forward and rude with her unsolicited opinions on my child-rearing. First it was that I'm cheating my kids by homeschooling them (never mind that I was nearly driven to suicide by the incessant bullying I received in my public school socialization, she's conveniently forgotten all of that). I rebuffed that easily enough. But now it's that I'm cheating them out of a relationship with Jeebus Christ.

Her email, begging me to let her drive my kids to VBS at 8:45 in the morning, is insane. She'd be driving 40+ minutes to pick my kids up and take them to a church that I don't attend to be watched by adults that I don't know? Hah, the last church she recommended to us had a news story break out the next year that a youth leader was molesting pre-teens! 

So I simply replied, ""no.""

And she says, ""okay. as a believer in Christ you know you are cheating your kids out of positive experiences with other believers.""

!! Now, she doesn't know that I'm an atheist but I've made it crystal clear for a decade that I'm uninterested in church. As it seems I needed to be more clear, I replied, ""Great. I'm not interested in your opinion on this at all. I've been super polite about it for years, I think you can get it by now or maybe I just shouldn't be as polite about it. So a simple ""no"" should suffice. Don't you dare tell me again that I'm cheating my kids. This subject is over.""

I have two kids, 5 and 2 and I'm growing a third. Just over a year ago we moved into my parent's ground level suite. It's been a great arrangement for all of us. The only downside is that there's only 1 (large) bedroom for my family of nearly 5. My big kid is in a twin bed on his own and the 2yo, hubby and myself are on queen+twin mattresses on the floor. 

Up until tonight the 2yo started the night on the twin then would come into the queen for snuggles around midnight and stay there. I'm getting to the point in pregnancy where it's getting more difficult to crawl out of my 10"" of space between hubby and toddler to go pee without waking everyone. Plus once baby comes I won't be able to do all the toddler snuggling as well as all the night nursing for the baby.

The plan is for me to sleep on the twin with the baby (it's a firmer mattress) and the toddler to sleep in the queen with hubby partly because she hasn't indicated any interest in sleeping on her own and partly because we have nowhere else to put her. Tonight is the first night of the transition. She's already woken once (10pm) and hubby snuggled her then she crawled away to find me so I half snuggled her at the edge of the bed and scooted back over to the twin once she was out. 

This is going to be as hard on her as it will be on me. We've got 3 months for this transition so plenty of time. But she's my baby. I'm going to miss snuggling her all night.",True,parent-child interaction
414,"I just wanted to write this to encourage you ladies who might be having doubts about your doctor or maybe just aren't as comfortable with them as you'd like to be. 

When I found out I was pregnant I went to my ob/gyn who I had only seen once or twice before since we moved here a couple of years ago. She was fine at my regular check ups but upon my first prenatal visit, I started to feel uncomfortable. First off, her nurse asked me if I was having morning sickness and when I said yes, immediately gave me a prescription for Zofran. I wasn't even throwing up and I didn't ask for medicine but she just automatically assumed I should take it. This rubbed me the wrong way.

I had a C-section with my first child 10 years ago but I had done my research and knew I was a good candidate for a VBAC. When I told the Dr. that I would like to try for a natural birth this time, she literally scoffed at me. Then she proceeded to tell me about the times she had done VBACs where they hadn't gone as planned and that when your uterus ruptures, it looks like a ""war zone"".

I left my first appointment feeling uneasy and unsupported. And then I decided, there is no way I'm letting this lady share in one of the most intimate moments of my life, much less be knee deep in my hoohah.

I Googled doctors in my area who were supportive of natural childbirth and called the first one I found. I met with her and my experience was amazingly different.  No automatic assumption that I needed drugs, total support of my desire to do this naturally, and more than willing to answer all of my questions. In short, I LOVE her.

I'm now 31 weeks and met with her today. I asked her about my concerns with episiotomies, ie not wanting one unless absolutely necessary, and about not cutting the imbilical cord right away. She was already on board. 

I had some self doubt at first about switching. I thought maybe I was being too picky or uptight, but I am SO glad I went with my instinct and switched.

But after getting the IUD inserted, I have had 2 periods, the first one of which was regular with very basic cramping (I cramped heavily for the full week prior to my period), and now this period is barely even a period: it’s mostly brown, I had one day of actual “bleeding” that was also brown, and then all the other days have been discharge.

I took 2 sleep classes when I had a newborn, did everything they said, was going pretty well, but then at 3.5 months old all hell broke loose and nights were out of control bad. I was losing my mind I was so sleep-deprived and started co-sleeping out of desperation after 2.5 hellish months of nightly battled. Now she’s 8 months old and is still a terrible sleeper and I’m just at a loss. When we lay her down in her crib for the night she only sleeps for 1-2 hours before waking up. And if we’re successful at laying her back down we get 30 mins at the most before she wakes again. And naps are only maybe 45 mins IF she even lets us lay her down without waking up and crying. If I hold her she’ll sleep for 2+ hours. 

So my question is - do you think sleep training (and by that I obviously mean letting her cry - a little, a lot, idk) is inevitable? I’m at such a loss. I never wanted to do that (not that I judge anyone who does! I just wanted to avoid it and it just doesn’t seem like something I’ll be able to stomach), but I’m so tired and her dad is frustrated and acts like I created this problem (I promise you I didn’t initially, though I definitely realize to finally get some sleep after 5.5months we did resort to some bad sleep associations but honestly I had no choice if I wanted to continue to function).

He can't really seem to handle any criticism of his lack of help.  Anytime I've brought it up, he gets super defensive and angry.  This makes him sound bad but he's not a jerk in general and he does do a reasonable amount of housework (although we have a housekeeper who does the majority of it).  I know he loves our kid, so I'm not exactly sure why he's not willing to put in more time caring for her.  It's almost like it's just not in his nature to go-with-the-flow and follow around a toddler.  And he did even less when she was an infant.  It's hard now too, because I'm clearly her favorite parent by far.  I mean, she almost never even says ""dada"".  She learned our dog's name before ""dada"".

I'm a bit worried that our marriage might not survive a second kid.  Although, now that I know what to expect, I think it will be way less devastating emotionally than the first time around.  On the other hand, not having another kid might be safer.  But I'm worried I'll end up resenting him.  I'm 35, so I feel like my window to have another biological kid is somewhat limited.

Right after the post we were gifted several months worth of disposable diapers and we moved to a new washer so we took a break.

We’ve been back in cloth two weeks and everything is going great! I wanted to share what changed in case anyone else is struggling with it.

My main issues and how I fixed them:

1. Smell. I was following Fluff Love and trying to create a large “stew.” It was way too much cloth in one load and not enough water. I was also using too much detergent. Basically the diapers were simply not clean. My routine now is so simple. I wash my diapers just like regular laundry but I do a regular cycle followed by an extra heavy cycle. So easy and my diapers smell great. 

2. Fluff bum. When my son was so itty bitty the fluff bum looked big enough that it bothered me. Now that’s he’s bigger and crawling it looks much more balanced and as a bonus it gives him a nice padded seat!

3. Clothing. I still can’t pull off onesies without causing leaks. But that’s also been improved with age - shirts stay on him and fit better now and the simple diaper + shirt combo is so easy for changes and also adorable.

Everything was fine. My husband got off work around five, got home around six as usual. Him any our one year old daughter played and let me rest. I haven’t been feeling very well the past couple days. It was nice to be able to lay/sit around for a bit. Around seven is always dinner time. My husband and little girl almost always share dinner since he eats a ton and she loves everything he makes. 

This is where things took a quick turn. My little girl had chili  and noodles all over her hands (one of my husbands special recipes haha). She came over to me. I was sitting on the couch in a very freshly cleaned blanket. I didn’t want chili on the couch or blanket. I know I probably shouldn’t worry much about that but I really take pride in my home being clean. So, when she walked over to me I said “No no no no no. Take it to your daddy,” I said it in a normal but stern tone. Nothing out of the ordinary but a bit quicker than I normally would. 

Well it scared my baby girl. I felt terrible and wasn’t sure what to do. During this my husband is saying how I scared her and I didn’t have to be that way. He also asked me to make her something else since I scared her away from his food. So I did. I made her more food and cleaned her up. Once the food was done she was sitting with my husband and he was feeding her again. So in the end she wasn’t hungry for what I made her. 

I tried to talk to my husband about him making me feel bad for messing up and he really didn’t have much to say so I just gave in and sat silently until he got her ready for bed and I told her goodnight, giving her kisses and wishing I could go back and not scare her like I did. 

I’m not mad. I never was with my husband. I was hurt by how he acted after. I just made a small mistake and I’m so upset over it. I would do anything to take him back. I just need reassurance from him but I didn’t get that. 

Don’t get me wrong at all. He is an amazing husband and an even better father. I love him so much. I could never image being away from him.

My first birth was a homebirth turned hospital nightmare, after 5 days of labor I had to go to the hospital, ended up with an epidural (horrible!) so I could sleep, a doctor who never looked me in the eye and kept trying to force me to get a C-section, antibiotics ""just in case"" Pitocin, people checking me without asking and pretty much every single thing I did not want to happen. This time around I'm thinking I might try a birth center. I'm a little hesitant to try homebirth again right now; it ended so badly for me.

441,"I see comments from parents of multiples a lot on social media, frustrated with others asking if their boy/girl twins are identical.  On the surface, it may sound like a stupid question, but the reality is, its not as stupid as many think.  The reality is, identical twins CAN be male/female.

There is a genetic condition called [Turner Syndrome](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/turner-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20032572) in which after conception, the X/Y sex gene is mysteriously lost.  This results in a zygote with only a single X gene which will develop to be female.  

In the case of identical twins, it is possible for an XY zygote to split into male identical twins, whereas later the Y gene is lost in one of them.  The result is an XY male and an X female with Turner Syndrome.

Turner Syndrome is not all that uncommon, it happens in ~ 1 in 2,500 births.  But due to the rarity of identical twins, it is exponentially rare with them.

I suspect the ""are they identical"" questions we get have a foundation with Turner Syndrome. People ""know someone who knows someone who knows someone"" that had identical boy/girl twins and they believe it to be more common than it really is.",True,play

443,"I started taking Gianvi about 2.5 years ago mainly for acne purposes. It was amazing and I had zero negative side effects until last July (2016). I experienced sudden and excruciating abdominal pain followed by endless vomiting and diarrhea within the span of an hour. I was taken to the ER after passing out, and after the doctors checked me out they couldn't find anything. The only abnormal thing was elevated pancreas levels. I was sent home with no answers and a $500 ambulance ride. 

Everything was fine until, once again, this past May the same pain, vomiting and diarrhea hit me. I tried to weather it out but ended up back at the hospital. Doctors gave me the same replies. Only minor elevated pancreas stuff. They kept asking if i drink alcohol (I drink maybe half a beer a month since i don't really enjoy it). 

I don't take any medications, don't drink or smoke, and I workout regularly. The only thing i took was my birth control. I looked into spironolactone and it's possible side effects -- acute pancreatitis was at the top of the list. Obviously i can't afford yearly trips to the ER, so now I'm going through my doctor to find a replacement that will help control my hormonal cystic acne. She placed me on the generic form for Demulen 1/35, called Kelnor. I can't find a lot of info on it through Google. At least not a lot of extensive, consistent reviews. I'm honestly extremely nervous about the switch because my first BC was Microgestin Fe 1/30, which gave me severe anxiety and weight gain. I don't want that again. It's been a week since i started Kelnor and i had a violent mood swing this morning, but I'm not sure if i can properly attribute it to the BC.

My question is: can anyone throw in their two cents about Demulen/Kelnor, and how long should i stay on this brand of BC before deciding if its right for me?

Acne control
Pregnancy prevention
No mood swings
No increased appetite

446,"I think this post is mostly a win, with a few sucky things combined.

So since SD13 came back from 10 day visit with BM things have been a rollercoaster. I always delete my previous posts because they usually include too much identifying info.. so to summarize the past weeks events: SD13’s BM has only 19/days a year custody after she moved far away (lost custody 3.5 years ago due to domestic violence and alcoholism) didn’t see SD for 7 months, didn’t talk to her for months until forced by the court. Last week she came back for her first longer than 48 hr visit with BM in 3.5 years and she said she wanted to live with BM. (BM has done a lot of messed up crap.)

Anyways it was a hard week for me and my DH. A child saying they want to live with the other parent is the last thing you want to hear if the other parent has nothing but awful, left the child, and hurt the child, has not provided for the child in years, when the other parent has costed us $80.000+ in attorney fees just to keep SD safe. And then to find out 10 days with BM was all it took, yep it sucked. 

After SD13 told me straight to my face she doesn’t care what her BM did to her, that she lied to me about everything she told me about her BM (I try really hard to not say a bad thing about BM, but SD was always talking crap on BM and I was there to comfort her.) I backed off completely, I made her food, that was about it, I wasn’t mean, I just kinda went into my room more, or just left the house, I was hurt.

My DH talked to our attorney, he said to not let her live with BM since we knew that wouldn’t be in the best interest, but to offer more time since BM will get more time in January anyways. We came to find out BM doesn’t want her to live there anyways, she wants SD just enough so she won’t have to pay child support, and that we have to pay her child support (she only needs 20% custody to get child support from us).. so that was out of the window. We offered another week later this summer to BM, she took that.

SD came to my DH a couple days ago and told him that she didn’t actually want to live with BM. I didn’t find this out until last night, DH said SD had told him she would tell me, but she didn’t. But that’s okay. 

A couple days ago and not really having any communication with SD and finally having calmed down, I just kinda sucked it up and decided to be an adult and took her to the movies. It was a movie me and her have been talking about for weeks. We had a good time.

From there things went back to normal. I didn’t hear a word about BM anymore. She was hugging, kissing me again and telling me she loved me. She came and hung out with me again. DH called BM and they settled on a week in August. 

Well now we know for the future, she just needed time to adjust to coming back home from BM and to probably just be patient. This was the first time we had to deal with this so it was tough for all of us. But now we know.

The sad part is, BM has been telling SD and her half sister (different dad) for weeks that she’s coming down this month for SD’s half sister’s dance recital. Both of them are excited BM was coming down to see them.. well as expected, BM has now said to my DH that she’s not coming.. we haven’t told SD yet, but I’m sure she’ll be upset. 

Bonus wins: yesterday SD13 came to me talking about tampons (lol) she’s always said that she will NEVER wear them. Until yesterday morning when she started a heavy period right on 4th of July when she was gonna go swimming. Her BM doesn’t even know she has started her period yet, despite having it for 1.5 years. SD doesn’t want her to know because BM posts that kind of stuff on Instagram (yes really) and SD is terrified of that, I’m the only one she will talk to about it.

Also: A couple days ago SD10 came running out of the shower naked freaked out laughing and yelling at the same time “HILTON! I’M GETTING HAIR DOWN THERE!” ...

**Request –** Any moms who almost exclusively breastfeed ~1.5 yrs that have any tips for feeding your kid enough during the day so kiddo doesn't wake up 3x a night to eat. Or any moms out there deal with an oral SPD that have any tips!?! Or transition tips from breastfeeding to my pumping and a cup??

**Background:** I love my daughter (19mths almost exclusively breastfed) she is amazing &amp; hitting all her milestones; however, she struggles with eating solids.
When she was born I wanted to try breastfeeding but was open to formula, if needed, but she took to breastfeeding really well. She started eating purees at 6 months. However, around 9 months she started rejecting all purees but she started to love the meltables and other easy foods. I thought maybe she just didn’t like purees as much as the other foods so didn’t think too much of it – a phase. 

At 12 months, her classmates were all eating a variety of foods and she’d only eat crunchy items like crackers/cheerios. So we made an appointment for her to get assessed and she has been diagnosed with an oral sensory processing disorder. She is now almost 19 months and progress is slow. I’m grateful she is still healthy and growing well as we are still breastfeeding. She has been doing OT (messy play to get used to touching and working our way up to eating) and Speech Therapy (to work on her chewing etc as she only has 4 teeth and tends to let food melt instead of chewing). We just met with a dietitian to try and figure out what she eats and how we can move forward from breastfeeding.

I’m STRUGGLING. I know some folks love breastfeeding and the WHO recommends until 2 yrs but I really didn’t think I’d be going this long. I didn’t mind it but this last month has just been – ENOUGH. I want to be done for my sanity. Around 12 months she used to drink pumped milk or formula (when I wasn't available) but I don’t know what happened as she won’t take any formula (different brands or flavors mixed with different milks/water) or even my breast milk in cups or bottles (I’ve been trying so many types). I’m so frustrated and dad tries – he does! But she’ll throw tantrums and won’t drink anything but water until I come home. The pressure of making sure I can always feed her is heavy.

My husband had noticed I have been withdrawing the past couple of weeks so he is trying harder to acknowledge my struggles and it’s helping my sanity but I just don’t know how much longer I can take breastfeeding Additionally, I'm not sure if she is getting enough during the day so she'll wake up 2-3x a night. We can usually get her down once without feeding her but after that she won't.

My daughter has had a lot of health issues since birth and been in and out of hospital and the one thing that would always settle her at night, especially in hospital would be a bottle. 

•She never has bottles through the day and eats plenty.
•I have tried offering warm water instead and she pushes it away and asks for milk.
•I’ve tried totally ignoring her and she will sit up in her cot for hours just sitting there half asleep asking for a bottle therefore making her very tired the next day.
• It doesn’t matter if she doesn’t have a nap in the day or how tired she is, she will still wake up for one.
•She generally has a bottle before bed 19:30-20:00 about 180ml then sometimes she will wake at 00:00 wanting another 90ml and other times she can go through till 04:00 having 90ml and that will be the last one before she wakes up.

It doesn’t bother me getting up and doing this as it takes me less than 5 minutes start to finish and I almost do it in my sleep now I’m so used to it but I understand it isn’t good for her to still have them at night. Also she gets a better night sleep if she has them rather than sitting for hours asking me for one. A few questions if I may;

•How bad is it for her to still be doing this?
•Do you think she will just grow out of it when she is ready?
•Do you think I should just ignore her and eventually she will give up?

I chose my older aunt and uncle, they are in there 30s and have been trying to have a baby for over a decade.Through out my whole pregnancy I was miserable, I hated it and I almost despised my unborn baby. But a week ago I gave birth and my whole mentality has changed, I feel love for him. He was taken immediately from the room when he was born upon my request, and I couldn't help but cry. It hurt not seeing him, and now my heart aches that I don't have him. I can't take care of him i suffer from mental illness and am in a horrible financial situation. I know I am not fit to be a parent right now, but my mind feels like it has had a complete change and now I want a child. I am so much more depressed and just don't enjoy anything anymore, I'm very suicidal I feel like I ruined my life.  Is this just the hormones or post partum depression? Do these feelings go away? Has anyone else gone through this? I just need advice or someone to relate to, I feel so alone.",True,

Routine has never been my thing. I'm pretty good at thinking out the small details and pretty bad at following through on plenty of those details. Especially with kids, there are so many ""shoulds"" and ""should nots"" that it gets overwhelming and discouraging sometimes. Being a stay at home mom, I thought I could take the time to build a solid routine for my son (15 mo), and I feel like I am epically failing. 

For one thing, I had to get a job, for my own sanity. I hate asking my husband for money and I need to be on my feet and outside the home sometimes. So I started hosting at a restaurant and have a pretty sporadic schedule, even though it is part time. I feel like any unpredictability in my job throws off any hope of a routine for my son, and for me. 

Also, my son has always had multiple caregivers -- mainly myself and my husband, but also my mom and MIL. They all take him while I get personal projects or housework done, and since I got my job, they take him while I work. We are all very different in our approaches to spending/structuring time with him. 

I guess the biggest thing is that my son is changing all the time. I feel like any routine I try and lay down is suddenly inadequate after a few weeks, and needs to be changed anyway, so why bother? He's also highly independent. He'd much rather play by himself than have me hover over him all the time, so when I try to engage him in certain activities, it is common for him to have other things in mind and do those things instead. 

Here are my specific questions:

1) What challenges did you encounter in establishing routine, and how did you overcome them? 

2) How detailed does routine have to be in order to be effective, and how can it be managed across multiple caregivers with different perspectives on childcare?

3) What factors of routine are more flexible based on a child's independence?

4) What does your child's routine look like, and how has it changed over the course of their life?

My DS son is 6 weeks old

He was in the hospital the first 3 weeks of life and the doctors didn't like the look of his stool or his growth rate, so they put him on a special formula (Elecare) so he could get more nutrients on the small amount of food he was taking.

He has a decent latch to both the bottle and the breast, but he doesn't always stay awake to finish the mere 80 ml we're told to feed him, so he has to be fed whatever he didn't finish from the bottle by feeding tube.  At night, we have him on a continuous feed via the feeding tube, so we don't even try feeding him with the bottle or breast at night (per doctor's orders). 

Our goal is to get rid of the feeding tube, but that can't happen until he's eating enough food via the bottle. Some days I just feel so defeated with how little he drinks from it that I feel like we'll never get rid of it!",True,"parent support,birth"

2. Swings and bouncers: I thought about getting a 2-in-1 to be cost effective. Those that had both, did you use one more than the other? If you did it over again, would you still get both, or just one? Do you think either are a necessity? 

3. Car seats: My husband really wants to get a convertible and skip the infant seat to save money. Did you try this? I have no qualms about holding my baby or using a carrier or stroller while we're out instead of lugging around an infant seat, so that wouldn't be a factor in my decision. And of course I would be sure that the seat fit my Newborn properly so that it would be as safe as possible. 

4. Carriers: What is your favorite type, and why? The Ergo looks comfy to me, but is it worth the cost? Can I get away with only using wrap, which is half the price of an Ergo? 

5. Best infant to toddler stroller at the best price? 

6. Bottle and wipe warmers: I know these aren't a necessity, but are they worth having? Is a bottle warmer easier or faster than other methods? Were diaper changes easier or more comfortable for your baby with warm wipes?

It just seemed like it was the right thing to do with me starting college and my living situation. I live at home but I'm currently sleeping on the couch.
I had called to get the abortion pill which My insurance covered so he didn't have to pay a dime or do anything. So I decided that an abortion was not what I wanted after going to NY to get away for a few days with his 2 sisters. I just couldn't go through it. It's a baby and why should it have to pay for our stupidity. I made it very clear to everyone that I wasn't doing this for him but for me. It's my body and if he doesn't want to stick around then fine. That just shows how much of a man he ISNT. I broke up with him cause of how unfair he was being and our relationship wasn't the best because we had rushed into it. Now he's calling me crazy for wanting to keep it because we have only been together a month and a half. He's calling me selfish because he's not ready for a baby.

I much rather this way for several lifestyle reasons, including we only have one car, my husband has to drive me to my appointments anyway because pregnancy makes me carsick, i get spontaneous tummy troubles that are best relieved by laying on the sofa in loose house clothes and using my own bathroom with 100x more privacy than a public toilet (*plus i'm weird about the social pressure to not be in there for more than 3 minutes even if i have layers of clothes to get hung up, plus my bag and a small child who's always with me. Other pregnant people have to use it, too! i just can't relax which makes things worse*), I have two other children, one who is 3 and can't handle hanging out for 3 fucking hours in a waiting room while a nurse makes sure i'm not getting up and walking around while waiting for my turn to get blood drawn and the other is in school, putting pressure on us to schedule everything carefully around getting him or arranging someone to get him, and so, we just plain don't have the 4-5 hours to take out of our day to do this. It's too much for us. Plus i'm just burnt out of getting blood drawn. I don't mind needles but or the actual process but, i don't want to do it anymore because...i'm bratty like that.


So, instead, i was prescribed a glucose monitor test, with lancets (needed to poke your finger), test strips, and even rubbing alcohol pads, and i test first thing in the morning and an hour after every meal and that's it! I set an egg timer as soon as i finish the last bite of my meal, record my results on a chart, and call it a day. for a week or so then turn in my chart.


**The pros**- 1) You can stay at home! That was the most appealing part of this to me. I'm a stay at home mom anyway so, getting a sitter for my daughter so i can go to an appointment is really just money we now don't have to spend. Which is very, very nice. And like i mentioned, finding someone to make sure my elder child is safe after school is now not a problem.

2) you get a monitor out of it. Not the most appealing thing, tbh, but, now you have one and a ton of supplies for it (i got prescribed a month's worth for a week). I don't see a reason to toss it unless i find there's no space for it anymore. Maybe i'll keep tracking my blood sugar sporadically for the rest of my pregnancy just in case. Haven't decided yet.

**The cons**- 1) you have to poke your finger to get blood 4 times a day. The nurse i spoke to was surprised this was a more appealing option to me because most people don't want to poke their fingertips. To me, it's not a big deal. It's slightly painful but goes away quickly thanks to the science of the lancet poker. (i'm not sure what they're called, i refer to it as my ""little bee"" because the lancet looks like a tiny stinger.) it's a 0.5 on a scale of 1-10.

2) an extra trip to the pharmacy and back to the clinic to give them your chart to review. Neither are a problem for me because my husband went to the pharmacy during my appointment (it's in the hospital we use and it's a clusterfuck) and we plan on going ahead and doing a maternity ward tour when we head back to turn in my chart. At our hospital, you can come in whenever to do the tour, but you have to get authorized through the clinic before you can go up there, for security purposes.",True,multiple children

I asked how far she’d let me go before intervention, and she said 39 weeks. Meaning she’d want to induce in week 39 if I don’t go into labor on my own. Apparently “recent studies of thousands of women” show no increased risk of cesarean when induced in the 39th week. With my first baby’s lack of progression she said that doesn’t look ideal for next time. I asked her if she thought inducing then might have caused the lack of progression, maybe it just wasn’t time. She said at the time she would have agreed, but these “new studies” say otherwise. And that not letting it go to 40 reduces the stress on the baby from pregnancy.... umm, what?

For background: My first was induced, I labored 23 hours, was at 10cm, pushed 2.5, but I got an infection. My fever and baby’s heart rate went up and baby was very high and wouldn’t come down so I had a cesarean birth. I have GD but my weight, blood sugar, blood pressure, everything is all spot on. 

I keep reading how important an on-board provider is, and I’m not getting that. This doctor helped me get pregnant with my first and delivered her, am I crazy to be thinking about a change this late in the game? It makes me very nervous.

One thing I wish I knew back when our baby was a new born is that advice from older members of the family may seem like it’s well informed and wise, when in reflection, it’s usually out-dated, unsafe and impractical.

The advice from these family members is usually a few decades old. For example, my grandmother hasn’t been a mother in over 50 years and things that she did back then were definitely advised at the time, but we’ve moved on in 50 years and these things are not safe or practical anymore.

At daycare, she and another girl are working on it. The other girl is more advanced in the process but they are both SUPER EXCITED about going to the bathroom- like it’s a little club that they’re both a part. 

The problem: my daughter is only sitting on the toilet, not releasing. Sometimes she holds it for a few hours at a time, or recently she has been making sure to pee in her pull-up before she gets on the toilet. 

At home, she’s doing all the right things, asking for the potty, manipulating her pull-ups etc. with few accidents. 

I think she has a stage-fright issue and that it makes sense to ratchet down the pressure and let her propose “potty time” but apparently she gets distraught when she’s not brought along for potty time with her friend. 

She seems more excited about the “club” aspect with her friend, than the utility of actually going to the bathroom.

572,"I’m sure this is going to be a novel full of rambling. But I’m broken right now and need to tell someone besides my husband and our immediate family. 

In July, my husband and I fell in love with a photo and a profile. I know we shouldn’t have. People told us not to, but we did. I called our agency the next morning and asked about the 11 year old girl we saw and read about. Although she could have been anywhere in the state, she lived in the same small town. Her agency was in the building next to ours. Her foster parents caseworker shares an office with our caseworker. We hadn’t spoken to our agency in months. We took time off because I had surgery. But, they were still going to call us that day to tell us about her. 

Everything seemed too perfect. Everything was falling into place. 

We didn’t have our foster license yet, so we sped though everything we still had to do. We interviewed with her caseworker and others at her agency. We were matched. We met her at a matching event. Later her caseworker asked her if she met anyone there that she’d like to get to know. She said us. 

Then we met again, this time she knew who were were. We spent the last month with her. She spent the weekends here. We saw her at least once during every school week. We celebrated Thanksgiving. We painted her room. We decorated for Christmas. We went to her doctors appointments. She woke up in the middle of a nightmare screaming for us. She eventually called me mama. She called my husband daddy. 

I knew it was all too good to be true, but I figured it was the honeymoon phase and once she moved in permanently her behavior would change and we’d finally start to deal with the underlying issues. 

Her foster parents told her caseworker And their caseworker that there weren’t many issues when she wasn’t at our house. There were upticks of past behavior, but nothing major. We talked to her about it. She always admitted to it. 

A few days ago her foster mom finally told her caseworker what’s been happening. She’s been destructive and was having a ton of issues. Worse issues than they’ve seen in the last two years she’s lived with them. 

Her caseworker sat her down to talk to her. They talked for an hour. She didn’t show emotion once. She admitted that she was going along with this to get out of her foster parents house. She thought we were “ok,” but she really didn’t like us. She didn’t want to live with us. Everything was an act. She’s known her caseworker since she was a baby. Her caseworker was sobbing. She didn’t show emotion once.

The last month there wasn’t one sign that she was making everything up. There wasn’t one second that would make us think this was an act. She was on 100% of the time. We’ve racked our brains and nothing makes sense. There were no clues. 

He caseworker is confused too. She had no idea. She thought they were close and had built a good relationship thought the years. Whenever she talked to her she seemed so happy and talked about how glad she is to finally have a family. She expressed sadness about her birth family and how she was changing schools. All the normal things. She never let on that there was such an underlying issue. 

We’re broken. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to pick up these pieces. I don’t know where to start. I feel like I’m drowning. 

Now there’s this bizarre month of my life where I was a “mom.” Where my husband was a “dad.” There was a month were our parents were finally “grandparents.” 

To most people (people we know, not the people on here who have been effected by adoption and/or foster care in someway) it might seem like there’s nothing to grieve. We were never parents. We were just getting to know a child. 

I miss her so much. But there’s no one to miss. We didn’t really know her. Half of me misses her so much I ache. 

I’m mad at myself for falling in love with her. I should have been guarded. The other half of me is so angry at myself for falling for this. I feel like an idiot.

573,"I’ve been wondering a lot about if midwifery care was a bad fit for me, if I’m just being overly sensitive, or if I had a bad midwife but the model of care could still fit my needs. 
I went into labour at about eleven at night. Regular contractions that got closer together, small amount of blood with each one. After six hours I wasn’t coping with the pain well anymore, and had my husband dial our midwife. 
She and I talked for a while on the phone. She was mainly interested in if my water had broken (no), and if I had an urge to bear down (no).  She suggested I take Tylenol. I tried explaining a few times that the pain was too intense. Finally she suggest that I take two Tylenol, and try to sleep, and that she would call me in an hour and maybe head over for a home check based on how I was doing. 
At that point I just gave up on her, and said sure, and hung up. I told my husband we were going to the hospital. 
He was pretty bewildered that we weren’t following her advice, and insisted on calling her on the way to let her know. I was in too much pain and had pretty much given up on her as a resource to care, and just let him talk to her. She was polite but clearly disappointed, and said she would call ahead so that they would expect us. 
When I arrived at the hospital the nurses treated me like I was being dramatic. I had to jump through a few hoops to get my cervical check, at which it was discovered I only had a lip of the cervix left. 
I remember my nurse saying she had to go call my midwife so she knew to come, leading me to believe she had told them I wasn’t actually in labour and she hadn’t been planning on coming for awhile. 
I obviously missed my epidural window. I received gas and air, but it didn’t manage my pain and was eventually turned off. 
I was told not to push. My midwife came. It hurt so bad not to push, and I feel like that went on forever. Finally I couldn’t not push, and managed to say that I couldn’t not push. They just said, oh that’s fine, you should be pushing. 
The water had meconium in it, and they asked me to start adding extra pushes after each contraction. Obviously hurt like the dickens, and I’m wondering if running around and doing paperwork while in transition and not pushing when I should have been made it necessary. 
When we talked about pain relief we saw a paper with a ladder of pain relief. I said I was fine with all of it if necessary, and it was made to sound like it wouldn’t be an issue, but when I was in labour begging for drugs they just said there was nothing they could do. 
The other thing is that I had pretty bad tearing and eventually a surgeon was called in to do the stitching. There was a stark difference between the surgeon and my midwife. She had been poking around for a while before she made the call to bring in the surgeon, and every poke hurt a lot. I didn’t want to hold my baby because I thought the pain might make me drop him. 
The surgeon instantly froze me, and it made things so much more bearable. The surgeon also acknowledged my pain and explained what was happening, which also helped immensely. 
I ended up seeing discharge papers, where it said I had a precipitous labour. When I looked up the meaning of that, it said a birth under three hours. I feel completely ignored, because my birth was not under three hours.

576,"I’ve previously posted about my son and some behavioral issues he was having in this sub. Luckily, those have subsided and he is now back to his happy, helpful self. 

The only reoccurring issue is that my son will not in any way shape or form accept food thicker than baby food and has not since birth. We’ve taken him to occupational and speech therapy, feeding teams, and other specialists over the years who have all given various versions of the same solutions and none of them have taken. 

We found out a couple of years ago his tonsils had been swollen for a long time and he got them removed when he was 6. He had previous to the surgery always choked on his food because of his lack of knowledge and chewing/size of his tonsils and we thought afterward he would get better. Wrong. Then we started to see it as a psychological issue of him associating food with choking. So of course we took him to a psychologist, also didn’t work. 

Now, I’ve been giving all of these things a long go, months or years of time, multiple at once or dedicating time to one. He does have his school that would need to accommodate the changes and he sees his father’s grandparents for 1.5 days every weekend who have been helpful but often give him a little more leniency. 

At this point my husband keeps saying that since he can’t keep weight on (he’s almost 9 and can’t get above 50 lbs) we will have to put him on a feeding tube.

596,"Little background: officially speaking I have the ""every other weekend"" visitation deal with my son, but in reality I get to see him more often than that because his mom and I are on relatively good terms. He's only 16 months old, by the way.

Sometime in the near future I'm looking to move into a new place with my best friend, but it's been incredibly difficult to find a place that's priced reasonably because I've been insisting on making sure my son has his own bedroom. I've been told not to worry about it too much since he's so young and I don't have him full time, but that just doesn't sit well with me.

I don't have many single-parent friends, so here I am putting this question to you guys: Am I being unreasonable? People who have been in this position before, what did you do? How did it work out?

EDIT: Well, some time has passed and circumstances have changed. I was originally looking to move in with my best friend not only because it would have been cheaper, but because post-divorce I was in a pretty bad way and didn't think I should be living alone. It's been nearly a year since the split however (and about six months since my buddy and I have started looking for places), and I think I'm ok enough to handle it. So my buddy and I talked it over and eventually agreed to go our separate ways in terms of living arrangements.

I'm still a little torn about whether to look for a one bedroom apartment or two, though the suggestion to partition off a section of a one bedroom for my son does seem like a reasonable compromise.",True,working parents
597,"Little history.  

When my kids were born I was a fundamentalist christian and damn near a theocracy advocate. Nearly 8 years later, I'm an atheist and an anarchist. 

I have found that over the years many bigotted things have come out of my mouth in front of my kids.  That caused some damage in the way they view the world over time.  

I have a child with aspergers and my attitude towards the LGBTQ community has clearly stuck with him as with the sexist jokes about a woman in the kitchen. 

Its been easier with my daughter who was only just 3 when I deconverted.  But still my son finds the subject of being gay uncomfortable and not right.  My aspergers child, is dead set in what I had once said.  And I can't seem to ever change these views even though the oldest is not even a teen yet.  

Any advice on reversing my own induced brainwashing towards bigotry? I regret having done it but I was a different person 6 years ago than I am today and my views are dramatically different.  There is a gay couple we used to go out with occasionally and while I said I was okay with gays, they could tell.  When I went back to visit my home town I met up with them again and they said they could tell a difference.  What I first thought was ""OMG if they could tell, how bad must it have been for my kids?""

In short they are still young and should be able to over come it.  but I fear I am woefully inept at it and end up just telling them not to think that way, which is wrong and they know it is wrong and call me on it.

I did not invent RIE. 
I am a new follower of the RIE principles, and I was surprised and a little disappointed that there is not as much publicity for RIE as there is for other parenting philosophies.

I feel passionately that every parent should have a multitude of parenting tools at their behest, so they can choose the one that aligns most with their values, core beliefs and situation.

I went through so much heartache while trying to bring up my son right, I would be so happy if anything I have learnt can benefit other parents.

Thank you for pointing me to the FFRF, their site has been a great resource. It looks as though our school district may actually be violating separation of church and state for the following reasons:

They do not require permission slips signed by parents before sending religious material home
They do not have a disclaimer that disassociates the school from the religious groups

630,"My Daughter (will call her Megan) is a bright, creative 12yr old who loves dogs / animals overall especially drawing them, online app “Amino”, Littlest Pet Shop and the play Hamilton – but shrinks from human interaction, especially her peers.

 

TLDR at the end, but hoping the story below leads to a possible solution… (?)

 

We noticed early on, (say Daisy-level of Girl Scouts), that Megan was loving all elements of being in Girl Scouts – except the human interaction (peers, adults, all of it). She loved making the crafts the most, trips to the zoo, or any field trip, or games with others were great, but she never made any effort to make friends/talk to the other girls. At the same time I noticed her \*one\* friend was an alpha type who kind of decided her and Megan were friends, and set the tone for what was going to happen when they had play dates, something Megan seemed comfortable with. As she progressed through grade school, Megan made maybe two or three friends, and those were very groomed/encouraged/made possible by her mom and I – not sure they would have flourished w/o our involvement (e.g. “You should text Kimberly about coming over” or “when you see Lia at school, don’t forget to invite her over this weekend”).

 

Megan (now getting ready to go into Middle School) does well in school (but has slipped the past year), the extracurricular activities she participates in she does fine in, but again its at a personal level. She is not comfortable talking with soccer team mates, or trying to talk to others in her school play. In fact, she struggles to create interpersonal relationships, and/or socialize at all. She is a self-professing shy girl, has trouble looking people in the eye, or saying thank you to a compliment from an adult, or saying hello to a classmate in public places.

 

Last summer as we got ready for her 6th grade school year I told Megan that along with academics, I wanted her to work on being more social/to try to grow her friend base; I don't know that my discussions / tactics I recommended were very good...

 

That brings us to the end of the 2019 school year. Upon pickup from her theater/play practices, she would tell her mom or I (in between her tears) that she is lonely / doesn't have any friends beyond her best friend. When others are chatting/goofing around at Play Practice, she has no one to talk to. (That broke my heart) The tactics I have tried to tell/show her for how to make friends (or at the very least – conversation), have not resonated with her (e.g. share compliments, ask questions, be goofy). Her feedback is generally, “Whenever I try to say something when a group is together (e.g.lunch table) it sounds stupid, and then I just want to run and hide.”

 

I’m really concerned for her, in particular as she gets ready to go to a much bigger school this fall (combined Middle/High School) where the percentage of people she knows / is friends with will certainly drop, while she has not developed any confidence level, nor a familiar system for talking/making friends.

 

Any suggestions on how to break her out of her shell? Good shows / YouTube clips or channels to watch with her? Magic Spell?

If she cries after that, wait 20 minutes, then 25, etc. 

 Now, my mother did this type of sleep training for me, and then repeated it when I was around 4\-5 years old and having sleep issues again \(parents divorced\). I remember it. It was awful. I remember crying, calling for her, and nothing. No one would come. I know that's a different type sleep training than my doc is recommending, but I can' t do that to my kid. 

But that's all she had to offer. Not one other tip or trick for helping her sleep. She basically said it's this or nothing. She made it seem like I was crazy for not wanting to do this. She asked if anyone in our families had a history of anxiety or sleep issues, and I told her I did. Then she asked if I had a psychiatrist, and told me to see one and get medication to manage my anxiety. Now, what she asked was about *history.* I do not currently have a problem with anxiety.

636,"My OH is getting SD9 this weekend. I think. Summer visitation is pretty variable with her activities. I'm not sure when/if we will have her for the 2 weeks either. I get really frustrated when my OH will tell me on a Friday night ""Oh we have to get up at 7 tomorrow to go pick up SD."" Before you say to talk to him about this, I have. All I want is for him to just let me know when he knows instead of making me ask, but I still have to ask. His family also seems to contact me about visiting us rather than him. I hate being the go-between, I'm not a member of this family why am I expected to be the coordinator? He facetimed with SD for over an hr yesterday but didn't say a thing about it to me. I never interact with her unless he has her, which is kind of weird to me. SD likes to talk on the phone so I don't know if she doesn't like me or my OH isn't really pushing for us to have a relationship. That makes me feel like I'm not really part of this family (well we aren't' married so I'm not). I'm on a need to know basis, between that and the expectation to coordinate stuff I'm not privy to it really makes me feel like an outsider, or the help. We talked about getting married and he seemed all for it. I'd understand his keeping me at a distance if we hadn't been dating for almost 3 years.



This is a pretty small problem but I've had a rough week and I'm exhausted. I'm very busy with work, I had some serious car trouble yesterday. My OH wasn't very sympathetic to it. I got everything fixed and it didn't cost me a thing since it was covered by the warranty, so it's not like I wanted money from him. I just wanted him to be interested in my life. It must be hormones but it takes a lot of effort to not be mean right now. I'm thinking of just working this Saturday to avoid seeing and taking it out on his family, SD, Aunts, Uncles, Grandparents. I'm also kind of terrified that I could be pregnant, but I won't be able know for another week or so. That stress is not helping. 



Does anyone else get frustrated with the expectation that a stepparent has to ""let themselves in?""

637,"My SO and I (and SD too) can now breathe easy.  A couple of months ago I posted about a situation that we had here:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/cm41jv/just\_when\_everything\_was\_going\_great/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/cm41jv/just_when_everything_was_going_great/) 

For a TLDR on our overall situation:  My SD 15 came to live with us about a year ago full time when BM passed away from ovarian cancer.  BM was raised by her father and step mother.  BM's father had given her $$ towards a downpayment of her house in cali in 2007. BM's step mom and half sister came out of nowhere in August and had us (my SO and I) served papers that they wanted 2/3 of the money that is in my SD's trust to go to them and wanted visitation of SD.

In September the attorney for BM's step mom called our attorney and was very forceful that they wanted us to settle out of court and they would settle for essentially what would come out to about 20% of what's in SD's trust.  My attorney was adamant that we shouldn't even consider settling since these folks had no involvement in BM's life or SD's life for that matter.  They were invited to many events for SD and when we organized services for BM they didn't show up.  The last time my SD saw them was when she was a toddler at some sort of family thing in CT that my SO has pictures of. 

Anyway we told them no multiple times, we were going to court.  Prior to going to court child protective services came to our house multiple times to interview us.  That was pretty awful.  The case worker assigned to us was assuming we were bad parents and were hiding money.  Even though we have all of the financial records in order and pretty much everything that BM minus a small % we used for down payment on the house we live in (which BM told us to do that she would not take no for an answer and put it in her will) is in a trust for SD.  They showed up at SD's school and pulled her out of class and were asking her all sorts of questions around abuse which is not what this case is about at all.  They also asked if she was happy that her mother was dead. What a horrible thing to ask someone who lost her mother.  She got very upset and SO left work to go get her.   My opinion of child protective services is now pretty low.  My SO and I complained and were told these were standard questions.  

If that wasn't bad enough case worker from CPS became obsessed with the fact that I'm 40 and pregnant. She kept asking why I waited this long and made all these terrible comments.  

We had our initial appearance in family court last week.  It was more of a moderation session. I've never been to family court so maybe this is how this always goes, but I expected more law &amp; order, but it was like everyone in a room that looked like a conference room.  The judge listened to each side and then he called upon SD and she answered a bunch of questions including if she wanted visitation with her step grandma and she said no.

The judge complimented us and how we have made a good home for SD after her mother's passing.  Since there was no evidence either way that her Dad lent her money or if she paid it back the judge ruled that it get thrown out. 

Because there was a family court case we are required to have two more visits with CPS.  I'm not sure why, but they suck.",True,play
638,"My SS is turning 18 this Saturday.  The custody schedule regarding SS17 is EOW.  This summer, he has been staying at my house most days as DH and he have been working together.  
Now my SS is a great kid who really really really loves spending time with DH.  I get why he always wants to be with his dad.  Before i was part of the family, BM1 basically would pick and choose when DH could see the kids.  Usually once in a couple of months, she would allow him to see them a night or have dinner with them at her house. I believe she was still bitter that he cheated and asked for a divorce to be with BM2 and she used the kids time as a way to control.  ( i came after that failed relationship)  So i get he missed a lot of time with dad and just wants to soak up as much as he can this summer.  
We have also had talks about when SS graduates high school, he can move in with us if he prefers.  He will be an adult and have the ability to make choices that he could not before.  SS is fully aware of this and DH, myself and SS had conversations about this.  Having him here most of the summer has kinda felt like a trial run. 
The only issue is that SS is legit like my DH's shadow.  DH walks into the kitchen, SS follows with in 10 seconds. If i try to have a conversation with my DH, SS will appear and offer his opinion.  (Which often is a repeat of what DH says.)  Monday i asked DH for us to have a little alone time.  We went to bed earlier than normal and  SS kept texting DH wondering where he was.  
I feel like a jerk cause the kid just wants to spend time with his dad.  They wake up together, they work together, they hang out before i get home from work, then they play video games or watch movies until it is time for bed.  Except for sleeping in the same bed as me, DH and SS spend their WHOLE day together.

660,"My daughter is in 4th grade, and she's spent all but kindergarden going to school in the bible belt. She has never had an issue with her beliefs (or lack thereof), until this year. Apparently her teacher doesn't give them homework on Wednesdays because they ""should be in church."" When they were discussing bullying and the beginning of the year, the teacher told them that they shouldn't bully each other because ""God didn't make you so you could be mean to each other"". Obviously these quotes are not direct, as I didn't hear any of this being said, but this is what my daughter has told me. 

All of the students know that the teacher is Christian (because she mentions in quite often, according to my daughter), and so the students all talk about Jesus a lot in class, and draw pictures of Jesus for the teacher. I feel that her teacher is creating a very Christian environment in her public school class room.

Yesterday, a little girl asked my daughter if she was Christian. She lied and said yes. When she told me about it, she said she was scared that everyone would *beat her up* if they knew she didn't believe in God, and she was ashamed. I obviously had a really long talk with her about it, but I'm not sure how to approach this subject with her teacher. The fact that there is a school environment that is so centered around Jesus and God that my 9yo would fear for her safety if they knew she didn't believe, is appalling. At the same time, I know that it's mostly the students doing all of the talking, and the teacher can't/won't stop them from talking about religion in school. I do still blame the teacher, though, for getting the ball rolling on talking about God and Jesus in the classroom. At this point, the ball is rolling full speed and even if she quits talking about it, the students will continue.

It just kills me that this is happening right now, because I'm really trying to work on building a sense of trust between my daughter and I. She doesn't want me to talk to her teacher about it. As a matter of fact, she started crying when I so much as mentioned calling her teacher. She said that the teacher would hate her, and she'd be so embarrassed. I tried to reassure her that her teacher couldn't treat her any differently because of it, but she still begged me not to call. 

I'm not exactly sure what to do next. Part of me wants to call behind my daughter's back, anonymously, but I still feel like that'd be a breech of trust. Another part of me realizes that situations like this are going to happen, and the sooner she learns to deal with it, the better. But I can't stand the idea of her being at school every day, lying about who she is and being scared that someone will find out. I'm thinking about asking for her to be transferred to another classroom, but she really does like her teacher. I just don't know what to do.

662,"My daughter is very good at going on the potty when we put her there ourselves. She will pee and poo on the potty at home or in a public toilet without hassle as long as we take her.

For example, ""What is your name?"", ""Do you want a snack?"" or ""How old are you?"" will be met with a blank stare, but she will spontaneously tell us her name, age, and whether she wants something to eat or drink in a full sentence. She will not even respond to simple sentences like ""It's time for bed,"" or ""Let's go to the park."" However, she will say ""We go to the park now,"" or ""I'm sleepy, bed time!""

I am worried about leaving my daughter in the hands of a woman who seemingly hates me, so I have asked my ex if she would be willing to meet up (all three of us) in a public place (restaurant) to discuss parenting plans for my daughter.

My question is: what should I ask/do/say? and Has anyone else been able to sit down with their ex's affair partner to discuss parenting, and if so, how did it go?



Here's some (hopefully pertinent) information:


*Due to the law of the state we got divorced in, we have had to live together during the entire divorce procedure. He has slowly been moving his affair partner in while I still live here.


*We waited to explain the divorce/move to our daughter until we were absolutely positive what would be happening with custody (he did not want me to move to home state and agreed it was best at the last moment) so she just found out a few weeks ago. She has had little time to process the divorce/move. I'm worried that he will thrust his affair partner on our daughter right after I leave, which could be traumatic for her.


*He has been bringing his affair partner around our daughter since October, so our daughter knows of her.


*He has been cheating on his affair partner since they started seeing each other, and I am worried that she might go ""bunny-boiler"" when she finds out.

This pregnancy (17w so far) I’m seeing a home birth midwife who is backed by the OB who delivered my first. They are both wildly knowledgeable and skilled, I’m completely confident in them both. The midwife has told me that the decision to deliver at home can not be made until ~38 weeks but everything currently looks good for a HBAC. The current plan is to labor at home under her care for as long as possible and transfer if/when needed. She would remain with me and continue with my care in the hospital.

670,"My girlfriend of 18 months has a 4 year-old son from before we were a couple. We don't live together and mostly see each other on weekends. She and him live with her mom and younger sister. Other than when he goes to see his dad for summers and certainly holidays, I'm the main adult male presence in his life.

Me and her have a great relationship, but for me, the son throws a wrench into things. We can't have much adult fun without significant advance planning because we have to find a sitter, so we either go do stuff that we can all do (which has its limits) or just hang around the house (both of which get old fast). 

My relationship with the son is complicated. He's not a bad kid, but he's not the angel my girlfriend and his family make him out to be. He's stubborn, often belligerent, doesn't follow directions, super picky eater, never wants to do anything but watch TV, refuses to eat meals but then wakes up in the middle of the night claiming he's hungry, throws tantrums in which he not only makes a scene but refuses to speak about why he's upset which makes the situation even more difficult to navigate, and most upsetting for me: he's a quitter. We'll try to teach him something or introduce him to something and he'll either outright refuse to attempt it or quit on it almost immediately, even when it's something he's capable of doing. Perhaps these are traits all 4 year-olds have, but they seem particularly egregious with him. 

On the other hand, he's whip smart, pretty clever, friendly to most, full of energy and has a good, kind heart. And these are the traits people always bring up when they talk about him. It seems like I'm the only one who sees when he's misbehaved, which is not infrequently (again, probably common for a small child, but still). Arguing with a chorus of his cheerleaders makes me feel insane or that I'm wrong for not loving him.

I struggle dealing with the kid. It know it's not necessarily my place to discipline him, but at times, I don't feel like his mom, aunt, and grandmother are doing a good enough job of curbing his behavior. There's a lot of picking him up and putting him on their laps and telling him ""hey, don't do that"", but never any real consequences when he does it again immediately. And I don't want to see the kid punished, but I think he needs it sometimes.

I wanna love the kid and grow to treat him like my own son one day, but it's a difficult road. Sometimes when I'm around him, I find myself filling up with anger, even if he hasn't done anything wrong. We get along sometimes, but other times I push him away when he's trying to bond with me because of his behavior I disapproved of from earlier that day or week. Ifeel like maybe I don't actually dislike him personally, but just resent him for 1. being an obstacle to an easier relationship with my girlfriend and 2. being the result of parenting/disciplining I don't always agree with.

Anyway, I guess my problem is that I know I'm the asshole in the situation (or at least I feel like it) and I want advice on what I should do. How can I develop a better relationship with my girlfriend's son who don't like half the time? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend's son from a previous relationship is a tough cookie but everyone doesn't seem him as I do. Even with his behavior, though, I feel like I don't treat him as lovingly as I should. I feel bad for not having a better relationship with him and I don't want to be an asshole to a good kid for the rest of my life. Please help.",True,emotion coaching

Or long term placement where their parents put in the work to be better for their children. I am fully aware the goal for fostering is reunification. However regarding adoption; we are wanting to navigate the process as best we can because we know that the child(ren) will be losing a large piece of themselves. I see a lot of people on this subreddit and the others who seem to resent or almost hate their adoptive parents. What can we do as to make sure our kiddos don't feel that way towards us?

673,"My husband and I are both atheists.  I was raised in a Christian church with a Pentecostal mother and an Atheist father. I went to church regularly and was a believer until my early 20's. My father never had a problem with us going to church because we were so young and he figured it wold work out when we got older.  He was right and as an adult, I am not a believer, but I am very respectful of the beliefs of others.  I very much dislike how polarizing religion is and really wish everyone could just keep their beliefs to themselves and get along as members of the same planet.  I know this is a bit naive, and I accept that.  Anyway, my husband is 100% different.  He views any non-atheist as an enemy spreading lies to further their agenda. When we were dating I found this to be annoying, but figured we'd work through it.  

Fast forward 11 years, we have two young girls (5 &amp; 3) and religion is really just not a topic in our home.  This is difficult because outside of my father and brother, my entire family is Christian. So my kids get tastes of Christianity here and there. But it's getting to the point where we can't just change the topic as a distraction.  We need to have a real conversation with our 5 year old.  

If I were a single parent, I would encourage her to learn about many different religions.  I would tell her that no matter what someone believes, it is near and dear to their heart and she must respect that.  Everyone is free to believe what feels right to them and she is, too.  I would tell her that as she grows up she will learn a lot about the world and one day it will become clear what is right for her life, but for now to explore and ask questions and learn as much about everything as she can. 

If my husband was a single parent, he would teach her that anyone who believes in God is spreading lies or is an idiot. That religion has led to some of the worst wars in the world and endless pain and suffering due to mis-guided ideas and interpretations.  That people use it to feel righteous.  Non-atheists are our enemy and deserve zero respect. 

So, this is really hard because we are equally her parent and equally have the right to share our beliefs, but I feel that his message of hate is unacceptable. He is respectful enough of me to have never shared these thoughts with our girls, but the time is nearing when we have talk with her about what Mommy and Daddy believe.  She knows that we don't believe in God, but we sort of just left it at that. She also knows that all the relatives that she loves and respects do believe in God. The situation has been exacerbated recently when she started school and became best friends with a Christian girl whose father is a minister. She hears many things at her friend's house and comes home with questions.  It's time to talk with her.

We're currently expecting our first baby (Yaaaaayyy!!!!!), and with Christmas and Easter and all that in recent months, we've been thinking a lot about how we'll celebrate religious holidays with our kid/s. 

Frankly, as a kid, and even an adult, holidays are fun. We both get into the Christmas spirit and decorate and it would be so much fun to have a bunch of presents under the tree for kids. And Easter egg hunts. And all the other fun holidays. For both of us, some of our best childhood memories are around the holidays.

We're still planning on celebrating these holidays and all the fun traditions with our kids. We also plan on explaining the history and origins of the traditions. Christmas and such is part of American culture, and we find no point in shielding them from the story of baby Jesus and all that. It's relevant in the society we live in. Even if one does not believe in religion, understanding religious context is important to understanding a culture. We'll present it as a story, just like any other.

I called the Lactation Consultant and she was adamant: We are overfeeding. It explains everything I was concerned about. I feel terrible. I wish I hadn't been naive. This morning I explained this to grandmother. She isn't really on board. She thinks he is gulping down the milk because he is hungry. Not so... it's his growth spurt and he is just more unsettled than normal, not hungry. He is eating so much during the day, he isn't nursing much at home which is why my supply is low.

I don't mean to rant. I need advice. Anyone have an experience where they had to confront daycare/family about feedings?",True,child product
702,"My son is 5 weeks old and we gave him his first bottle tonight.  My husband fed him and started him with 2oz which he ate vigorously.  We tried all the paced bottle feeding methods as well.  After he ate those first 2oz my husband changed his diaper, but he was obviously still hungry so he fed him another oz, waited a while, and then fed him a little more.  He ate about 3.5oz.  I don't want to overfeed him but since I have been only breastfeeding him, I don't know how much he typically will eat.  He has never gone more than 3.5 hours without eating and has always been a good eater, if that makes a difference.  Is this normal?  Is he eating too much?  If so, what should I do?",True,child product

Lately he has been really rebellious. When its time to go somewhere, or when I ask him to do something, or when I put dinner on the table his answer is almost always ""NO! I'm not doing it!"" I try and let him suffer natural consequences, but when it comes to something like doing a few chores around the house (my view is that we all live here, we should all do something to help out, I don't ask him to do much). If I just let him do whatever he wanted he would just play video games and sit on the couch ALL day. 

If he doesn't want what I am serving for dinner I let him make something else, but *I* wont make it for him.

704,"My son is 8.5 months old. We've coslept and breastfed on demand from the beginning. All of this is great. However, a few things are tripping me up. My brother committed suicide a week before my son turned 6mo. I'm not sure if it is just a timing thing, but ever since then it feels like his sleep has gotten much worse. I feel like we were waking up 4-5x a night then and now it is more like 8-10+. I'm exhausted. I feel like he is a newborn again. Someone suggested the No Cry Sleep Solution, and we are looking at it now. I'm just worried because we have never had a schedule or routine before. I don't want to be glued to my house at particular times for naps. Maybe that is my problem, I like to get out and do stuff, he used to sleep just fine on the go in his wrap. Now seems he wants a quiet bed, with me in it at all times. I don't want to night wean by any means. I'd just like 2-3x waking instead of 8. Am I being unreasonable? I know I'm having a harder time being patient because I'm depressed over my brothers death and sleep deprivation just makes that worse.

705,"My son is a very new four years old. Lately, his dad and I have both expressed frustration with my kid's newfound love of sass. He will tell adults to be quiet, or that they're not his boss. I'm saying this to explain that we are both aware, and working with our kid on understanding that that isn't okay. 

To clarify, I'm not talking about full out tantrums. He's never screamed at me or attempted to hit me. His behavior isn't out of control, or destructive. Basically, it's mildly annoying. 

I went to pick up my kid at the babysitter yesterday. Pretty much every day she tells me he's had a bad day. He threw something. He wouldn't eat lunch. He wouldn't nap. I walk away feeling discouraged every time. How is he *that* bad every day? I live with this kid. I'm not walking around stressed and upset with him. Maybe he's different there? 

Yesterday though. I walked in, and the first words out of her mouth were, ""We had a mouthy little brat today"". At first I thought she meant someone else brought their kid. I seriously couldn't believe she was referring to MY kid as a brat right in front of me. She continued by explaining that my kid told her fiance that he ""wasn't the boss of him"".

I'm thinking about firing her. It's totally cool with me that she's frustrated. My kid isn't her own. His sassiness may feel out of control with her. However, I've worked at a preschool. I've been hit, scratched, bit, screamed at. I still didn't tell the parent that their kid was a brat. It left me feeling like she just doesn't like my kid and that maybe that isn't a healthy environment for him to be in. I don't think she would ever hurt him, but if she's calling him a brat to me, what is she saying to him?

I dunno. Am I just being overly sensitive?

We're using a Phillips Avent trigger-style pump and the bottle that came with it, along with a bottle by Mam, for now. When I bought the pump, I was told by no means to expose it to high temperatures but rather to sanitize it with warm salt water. Then again, the manual that came with the pump talks about boiling for five minutes, so clearly the plastics and silicone can indeed handle that temperature.

However, along with being a new dad, I'm also a homebrewer. I use a weak dilution of peracetic acid for sanitization when I brew. It's basically a (mostly) chemically-pure mix of vinegar and peroxide. If a spray bottle of peracetic solution or a quick dip in a bath of the stuff is appropriate for sanitizing the bottles and pump, it would save a lot of time and possible wear on the equipment, but I'm not going to use it unless I know it's good.

I suspected he had the inattentive type, though he does seem hyperactive at times. He is struggling with a couple of things in school so I mostly wanted to see if this was an issue, so we could have some resources available for him so he can succeed. But after completing and having his teacher complete the questionnaire we were given, he didn’t score high enough for a diagnosis. What the doctor did notice is that the co-morbidity section of the assessment pointed to anxiety. This is not news to me, he has suffered anxiety since he was very young (DH has it also) and it has always been a concern of mine, though I wanted to wait to see if it got better as he got older. It has, though it is still an issue. The doctor who analyzed his ADHD assessment said that a lot of symptoms that look like ADHD can actually be related to anxiety. She also said that the very things he is struggling with in school (reading comprehension, inference, inability to re-tell a story/passage) are also things that children with anxiety struggle with. Honestly he explanation wasn’t convincing, but her next steps for us were to either see a psychiatrist or a developmental pediatrician. I’m going the route of development pediatrician at this point, psychiatrist doesn’t feel right.

734,"Now I don't have it as hard as other kids my age, and I certainly don't get abused, but here basically my life story so far(also this is on mobile). My dad had a really cool job as an IT person and wouldn't be at home until late 6 pm, but only on the weekdays. My dad stayed home on the weekends and basically went full anti-vaxer mode on me(I am vaxed btw, he just acts as if I am not). From the day I was born to when I was about 9, he usually came home, said hi to us, went straight upstairs and vanished until my mom started watching her tv shows at around 8pm. In that time I would usually get some device like my phone or my mom's tablet and waste time untill I had to go to sleep. During the weekdays my entire day was fine, until it came to the weekends. As soon at it is 8 30 in the morning, my dad basically shoves me off my bed and tells me to go use the shower. On the weekends my dad has 4 phases. 
1: The weird( almost a perv) phase
2: the calm, ordinary parent phase
3: Full on anime fight phase
4: The lecturer

Phase 1: My dad gets really close to me at times and is creepy at some points. Although I'm a boy, he almost treats me as if he was a low level pedophile! Some days, he'd even take a shower with me or use the same bathroom as me even when I am occupying the space, and now that I'm looking back at it, I'm disgusted at him, but more disgusted about how I never told anybody else. Right now, as I'm writing this post my dad is making smooching noises and it's bothering me, a lot.

Phase 2: This phase is what everybody would expect from a parent, a nice, sane parent. From an occasional I love you to him asking how I am, he's nice and gentle. But soon it all changes when  I do one simple thing wrong. Apparently not pushing a chair 2 inches further on the table results in him going to phase 3, and trust me it's always a bs reason. Most of the time it isn't my fault at all, sometimes even his!

Phase 3: Shit's about to go down. I normally don't curse but just thinking about my dad acting like this is just, ugh. Before I said that I wasn't abused, and that's true, but the amount or times he's hit me as a child makes me wonder if I should've called CPS(child protective services). I remember him hitting me with anything he sees in sight, even hitting me with my sisters phone, my wet towel, and even A FUCKING HAMMER. I remember crying so hard my face was eroded by water. I can't even express how much pain he's caused on to me, and I even tried to kill myself once. Along with this sadness that he causes, I also have my array of 'sicknesses' as he calls them. Ever since I was born my skin around my arms and face have always been terrible, and over time I'm embarrassed to wear shorts, short sleeves, or any other clothing that expresses my skin to school or in the public. My dad buys these foreign essential oil packs and pills hoping it will help me but none have availed so far(this is what I meant by full anti-vax mode earlier)

Phase 4: Full on lecture. If me or my siblings do one thing wrong, there is going to be a big meeting for at least 1 or 2 hours long. In this session he would basically blame me for doing something wrong and vent all of his anger on me going off topic( for example pushing in chairs went from that to a full on closing the door securely but not too loud. Like how in TF did he get there?). I remember my sibling wanted to join marching band( and my other sister was already in it) but he had the same conversation that he had with my sister and it didn't even help in any way! Also, my sibling got hurt from marching band(very minor) and my dad almost took her out of it, and that was a day before the final competition. 

Needless to say, I've always had mixed feelings for my dad. Overtime I've learned to find a way to basically divert myself from his field of destruction and he rarely ever hurts me as much as he did before. If any of you are still reading this long post(which nobody would since im basically worthless), and you can relate, just hang in there. It gets better as time goes on. Suicide is never the way to escape, and there are many other places to get help and the life you deserve. This is my first post but most likely my most important one, so if anybody has any tips that can help me please do so!

I have missed pills before and I might do it like 5 times a year. I last had unprotected sex on May 23rd but had gotten a really light period the following week on the 28th, and usually my periods are heavier and last about 3 days. Then I started bleeding heavier than normal on June 22nd to 27th (3 days earlier than normal) and it wasn’t regular red blood it was brown. I was suppose to start my period today but still nothing.

I got off my BC in October. After six weeks of no cycle, my ob said my pcos is probably the cause. So she put me on a 10 days dose of Provera. It worked.

I had my mirena inserted a month and a half ago. A few weeks ago I thought I felt that the strings were out of place and thought it was rejecting.

She told me to not check the strings though because I have high anxiety and if it was in place and all good after a month it would be fine. That seemed weird to me. Do you check for strings?

They work 40 hours a week, I do as well, and my brother has had multiple surgeries due to an unnoticed cyst. Even if I was getting help, or my parents asked for help, they would sit on their phones every 10 minutes. This added alot of stress in my life because I struggle with mental illness and was having a terrible time at high school, they knew this. I've been a consistent pot smoker for over 2 years now and it helps with my stress and forgetting how belittled I feel. 

Ever since I was 9 or 10 my mom has also made me her dog. When she wants her water refilled or needs something from downstairs she doesn't get it herself, she asks me. Just now she asked me to get cookies and a ginger ale from the kitchen which is 10 feet away from her. These are everyday/every other day things. I thought it was normal for awhile and I was just making my mom happy, but my girlfriend says I'm being walked over. 

They also ask me for money when they run short and I provide each time because we need to live. But, my mother has a shopping addiction and will buy anything at anytime on her phone. She once spent $4,000 that was going to be used towards a car on leggings. My brother and I have given them close to $10,000 combined, my brother was less fortunate and gave them 75% of that.

LO is 26 mo and has two older siblings (5F and 7M) and is demonstrating little desire to begin talking. In all other areas, she is developmentally on track... it’s just this talking that she’s stubborn about. I know that she can hear and understand what I’m saying because I will ask her to put her shoes on, put something away, eat, locate a body part, or point to an animal in a book and she listens. However, she has little interest in talking.

So far the only words she uses regularly are: ma ma, da da, baby, go, me, hot, ok, yay, pretty, and na na (what she calls me). She didn’t start to use these until about two months ago. 

She will also make an oink sound, a horse neigh, and a roof for a dog that she loves to do all day long. 

I think the problem is that she has no NEED to verbalize because we can understand what she wants through her non verbal communication (I.e she will pat the floor if she wants me to sit, Pat an object if she wants me to open it, point to food if she wants to eat, shake her head no if she doesn’t want something). Her siblings do not talk for her, but again, we all know what she wants through her non verbal cues. I have watched countless early intervention speech therapy videos and have done the tips and suggestions such as sounding out the syllables, verbalizing and enunciating the syllables when she points “oh you want an AP-PLE, say AP-PLE”  I noticed when I ask her to say something, she will make a whining sound and shake her head all pouty. If she does say a word it is usually unprompted. 

Everything else she just refers to as “BA BA” or “GAH GA.” Mom and I are starting to worry and get frustrated... what can we do? Any tips/advice??? Ps.

770,"Quick backstory my (25M) girlfriend (22F) had a solid life for our age (we were 23,21 respectively when we found out we were expecting) I had just finished college and just got a good paying job, she was working full time. We had just moved into a luxury apartment and adopted a puppy. We did whatever we wanted, had no time to think about having a baby or anything (in fact I don’t even think we once discussed it, even in jest) we were living comfortably and I don’t think either of us wanted to have a baby. Fast forward about 6 months after we moved in. We had just come back from a vacation with some friends and she told me she was pregnant. She was visibly distraught and was like that for quite a few days. Neither of us knew what to do, we didn’t want this baby, it was going to ruin our way of life. 

Well luckily our families supported us through this time, and helped make sure we were on track with everything we needed to prepare. I was out of town for business when she had learned we would be having a boy (to which I was excited) and the next few months moved by quick. She worked doubles every single day up until like 2 days before she was due, I still have no clue how she did it. We saved every bit of money that we could.

Then he was born (1 year, 1 month ago) and y’all.. I have no idea why I didn’t want this baby at first. Ever since the first second I laid eyes on him he’s been my world. Before I wake up and go to work I want to check on him (although I don’t because I don’t wanna wake him up for my girlfriend to deal with that early lol) and I get so excited to come home and play and spend time with him. Used to be I couldn’t wait for the weekend so I could go out with my buddies, now I can’t wait for the weekend because that’s 2 full days I get to spend with my son, who I guess is my best friend now lol. I’d do anything for the little guy.

I know 24 isn’t that young compared to some other people who’ve had children young. But man I’m just so excited to be able to still be young when he grows up so that I can do everything with him. Hell I’ll barely be 41 by the time he graduates high school. I can’t wait to be able to help him with sports, fix cars, anything he wants to do.

771,"Quick summary.  I'm 37, this is my second pregnancy, di/di twins, naturally conceived.  My first pregnancy was a singleton, my son was born 11 months ago.

With my first son, due to my age, we had cell free DNA testing done, to screen for genetic abnormalities.  I've also had all the standard (and some non standard) testing done to see if I'm a carrier for anything horrible (I'm not).  We were planning on doing the same testing for this pregnancy, knowing that with twins, it's an imperfect science.  I just got off the phone with my perinatologist and he said that the American Society of OBs (I believe?) just released a statement saying that they did not suggest that cell free DNA testing be used in multiples, due to a lack of studies on the effectiveness and accuracy of said tests.  The perinatologist offered the possibility of quad screening, as that's been around much longer, but did note that it's got a 5-10% false positive rate, and given my age, it's probably going to be closer to the 10% side.

We're scheduled for the NT scan next week, at about 11+4.  To be honest, I was depending on the blood test to settle my nerves about something being wrong, but the doctor, who I respect a great deal, doesn't think it's a good idea.  Does anyone else have experience with any of these tests in a multiples pregnancy?  At an 'advanced maternal age'?  What happened?  Was it useful, was it a good idea?  I don't want to do invasive testing without a REALLY good reason, the risk of miscarriage, no matter how small, is scary, but I also don't want to have to carry a fetus that's incompatible with life because it's too dangerous to do a selective reduction by the time we find out.  I realize the risk of something being wrong is quite small, but I'm a worrier.  The blood test really put me at ease with #1, I was kind of leaning on that this time too.  :/",True,sleeping
772,"Really needing some perspectives because (I'll just go ahead and blame them) these pregnancy hormones are making me a little sensitive, especially to pretty much anything my mother-in-law does. We have a great relationship, but shes known for being a little over-the-top. 

Just to give some context, my husband and I are having our first baby in March. We are so excited and so are our families. My husband is a grad student and we dont have a ton of money right now but are doing okay and willing to do whatever to make things work for this baby. I think my mother in law thinks we are one bill short of eviction and keeps trying to buy us really expensive gifts for the baby (my husband's family is pretty wealthy). It feels like she is somehow trying to compensate for the fact that we can afford some of this stuff ourselves. Specifically, she told us she would like to buy is a rocking chair, which is great. One less thing I have to buy myself. But the one she is wanting to get us is 400 dollars. I feel this is excessive no matter how much money you have, and I dont know if I'm comfortable accepting this gift. 

Anytime she buys us something, she tells me how much it was, and that makes me really uncomfortable. Is she complaining that she spent so much? Does she want me to feel guilty? Does she want me to fall at her feet in gratitude? I just dont understand. I also feel like, if you're going to spend 400 dollars on us, pay a hospital bill or help pay for something more important than a rocking chair! Thoughts? I'm open to all perspectives.",True,sleeping

774,"Recent college grad here trying to decide between midwifery and OB/GYN as potential career paths. I am traditionally pre-med and have completed all the requirements for medical school, but recently (last 3 months or so) have become very interested in midwifery as a potential career. I know that if I attend medical school, I would specialize in OBGYN because maternal health is my passion. In terms of rethinking medical school, I enjoy the autonomy of being a doctor, but don’t necessarily feel thrilled by surgery, which I know comprises much of the OBGYN scope of practice. I’ve shadowed many OBGYN’s and feel like their patient contact is very constrained. Conversely, the midwives I’ve shadowed (at an academic hospital and a free standing birthing center) have a completely different relationship with their patients. They seem much more holistic and open to birthing plans. I feel I am unique in that I want to go to midwifery school as a first career choice rather than switching from nursing as many people do. I am interested in a direct entry 3-year bachelors to CNM program. I want to be able to open my own practice someday, and life balance is important to me.

My 17 y/o is not college bound - she has had a lot of trauma which has contributed to her not being on track to graduate with a regular HS diploma.

She’s smart and kind and eager to learn, but she has a different starting point and pace and needs help feeling safe. Among other things, no regular HS diploma means she will not qualify for financial aid, even to take a class at the community college. 

One of the most positive things in her life is her job in food services - she is learning and contributing there and I’m proud of her. After HS, she can work and continue to learn skills to enable her to be independent at some point in the future. It won’t be when she is 18, but she does not understand this. She wants to be independent right now.

Now, I would never encourage her to call me that, but if she's comfortable with it, I'm totally okay with it.
The point is, even amidst the feelings I was having toward whether ""step mom-ing"" was something I essentially wanted or not, it definitely affirmed to me that I'm doing something right in this little girls life for her to look at me as a motherly figure and feel comfortable enough to call me as such.

Should I just stick with the swing so he gets a long nap?

I just started a new full time job, I had to switch daycares, and now I'm facing a brand new living situation, and I'm having a little trouble. My son is having issues adjusting to everything new, but it seems to only happen when he's with me. When I'm not around, my babysitter says behavior wise he is great. There are no issues with his appetite, his demeanor or anything. 

But as soon as I pick him up from daycare, and get him in the car, the whining starts. He whines, he cries, and his favorite word for everything right now is ""no, it's not."" We went from living with just he and I to living with 4 other people, so I know it's a HUGE change and he doesn't know how to deal with it. He doesn't get as much one on one mommy time as he used to when we lived alone and I only worked part time.

What I'm wondering is how do I help him adjust? What things can I do to ease the transition into all these big changes? It's beginning to be very frustrating for me because it seems like nothing I do helps. I am trying to make sure I always pay attention to him when he's talking to me, but when it comes to normal, every day things like bathing, going potty, even eating, he HAS to have me there or sitting on my lap for him to even be calm.

828,"Some backstory. Me and my two full siblings were raised mainly by my father. He passed away a few years ago and during that time my mother remarried and has 3 children with her current husband. Including me the ages of all my siblings go 27, 25 (me), 21, 9, 8, 2. Also, my mother and her husband both work around 60 hours a week at all hours so there is no schedule in their house.


Now my mother and I have a strained relationship and only reconciled after my father's passing for the sake of my younger sister (21). I visit her and my half siblings around 4 times a year and every time I go up there I leave feeling sad for those kids. Comparatively to me and my siblings, those kids are extremely behind developmentally because no one is helping them with schoolwork, they are never allowed to leave the house or play outside, and they are not being taught any moral baseline. 


I always keep this to myself and try to help in ways that I can but I almost lost it at the most recent news I heard from my sister (21) that lives with them. The older two kids (9 &amp;8) saw a cat outside with a collar that was very friendly and decided they wanted it. So they brought it into the house and that was it. My mother decided 'looks like we have another cat hahaha'. I told her 'it has a collar and was friendly on site? That is some other family's cat. At least go to a vet or shelter and have it scanned for a microchip'

My mother's response ""Not this again! If you take that cat from them you're going to break their hearts!"" And then she walked into her room and went to sleep. This is incredibly wrong in my eyes and should have been a perfect opportunity to teach the kids ""look someone lost their family member! Let's help find them and be good people!"" My sister (21) has tried to find the owner's but the same thing happened with her in that my mother wouldn't let her.

The only excuse I can find for my mother and her husband letting their kids do things like this is that they are so tired from work that they have essentially 'given up' on parenting. To you parents out there, is this what that is?

UPDATE: I posted a found kitten ad on craigslist myself and I believe I have found the owner within an hour of the posting. They have proof and all the correct information about the kitten.

832,"TL/DR: concerned that a 4 month old baby isn't being given a chance to develop motor skills because she is constantly held. Also, that the mom (26) may have a form of PPD/anxiety. Seeking advice how to gently make her aware or guide her to loosen up a bit.


Baby girl is 4 months old. She is held almost all the time, even while sleeping day or night. Mom will lay her on the bed briefly for changes, few mins of play, but never in the floor. Tummy time is rare. The excuse is that the sternum bone seems to stick out more than it should and she's afraid it hurts her. She keeps mittens on her hands day and night. 

While she is a first time mom, she has experience watching nephews from birth and being around small children. She has read all the many things most moms read about about development, etc. so she isn't unaware. 


She hardly leaves the bedroom. She doesn't lay her in the floor, a pack n play or crib. She doesn't put her in a walker, high chair or anything. 

I'm concerned she's not giving the baby a chance to develop motor skills such as grip, rolling over, sitting up, etc. I feel like she needs gentle guidance with her own child despite doing well with other children.

 I understand that feeling of not realizing what your child is actually capable of and allowing it to happen. I understand sometimes it takes watching another parent to realize it is ok. Ok to lay the baby down in a safe location. Ok to walk into another room for a moment. Ok to put baby in a safe place within vision while you cook, clean, watch tv, take a shower, whatever. 

I know she has seen other parents/guardians do these things. I, myself, have told her it's ok, the baby is and will be fine. I fear she has undiagnosed ppa and I know she will never seek help for that.

Most of the time it's portrayed as a very ""pink and fluffy"" life, and it's something I take issue with as a father who wants to be prepared for *real* reality, not a sugar-coated one.

I love my daughter, and she makes me absolutely happy and grateful to be her father. I have never met a human being who is so consistently happy and eager to learn and play.

With the exception of walking, and some talking, she has hit every one of her milestones early. She's cruising now, so walking should be very close. She's talking, sort of, mostly two syllable words, but she likes to stick to ""da-da"" or ""dog-dog"", sometimes ""ma-ma"" but it's rare, but I've seen that as normal for language acquisition as the ""D"" sound is easier to produce at first.

My (28f) boyfriend (34m) of almost four years and I had a serious conversation tonight about children, and I have always been adamant about not wanting kids and he wants at least one. The more we talked about it the more I realized that if I ever was going to have kids, I would want it to be with him.

I helped raise my oldest niece for the first year of her life, so I've done the infant thing.

As far as I'm aware he's never had to deal with small children except his own nieces and nephews at family gatherings, and I don't know if he's conceptualized how much babies change everything. He's an avid gamer and kind of a heavy drinker, so those are both things that I'm not sure he understands won't last long into fatherhood.

848,"This is a random, custom recipe I just do when we will want something tasty and pretty easy.


Ingredients:




1.5 - 2 pounds chicken breasts, thawed  
Half yellow onion  
One container of FRESH salsa, not the stuff from the chip aisle. Should be very little liquid in this salsa. Usually in the produce section.  
One jar of enchilada sauce.  
2 packets lower sodium taco seasoning.  
Pack of small corn tortillas. Need at least 15, maybe more.   
Cheese of some sort. I always shred my own. You can use whatever you want OR you can use the white queso dip.  I buy some from the local Mexican restaurant and bring it home.  



Directions:

Allow 6-8 hours for chicken to cook in slow cooker. I always go for the longer period of time rather than the shorter.  
Slice the half of yellow onion into rings. Layer on the bottom of the slow cooker.  
Drop chicken into slow cooker.  Pour salsa and enchilada sauce in (all of it!)  
Pour in taco seasoning.  
Cook on high for 1 hour and then cook on low for remaining time.  
Once you have cooked the chicken long enough dump the whole lot into a fine strainer.  No need to let it drip dry, just getting rid of the mass of liquid.  
Pour everything you have in the strainer into a bowl and shred away with two forks!  
Heat up your corn tortillas about 6 or 7 at a time in the microwave for about 40 seconds between two moist paper towels.  
Grab a corn tortilla, line the center with shredded cheese or queso dip and then on top of that put the shredded chicken.  You want to have enough to enjoy but not so much that you cannot roll up the tortilla completely.  
Roll the tortilla, put a toothpick through to hold it shut, and place in a baking pan/sheet of some sort.  
Repeat until you are out of chicken or tortillas or until you have enough taquitos for your meal.  
Place in 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  Check them.  When the edges of the tortillas start to crisp and brown you can take them out.  Let them sit for a few minutes and then plate them! Very yummy!

849,"This is also posted in r/Nanny but I wanted to get other parents perspectives.

First  time parent to a 3 month old preemie baby. We had a potential nanny  come meet the baby and take care of her for a couple of hours so we  could get to know her. She kissed the baby on the face within just a  couple of minutes of holding her for the first time. I was sort of  confused and let it go for a minute. Then she did it again twice in a  row a few minutes later. At that point I told her not to kiss the baby  as we are worried about germs, her being a preemie and still so little.  Also it is flu season. Either way isn't it weird? Even if it were a  close friends baby or family members baby I wouldn't kiss a newborn that  wasn't mine and this woman is basically a complete stranger.  My  problem now is that I feel uncomfortable with her when she is otherwise a  very nice person and seems to care about the baby. I also mentioned the  first time we spoke that I would like her caregiver to have had the flu  shot. She went out and got it the next day. I want to specify I did not  hire her and did not ask her to before she did it. So now I feel bad  since she thought she had the job and she got he flu shot for apparently  the first time in her life. But, I just cant shake the weird feeling I  got. Am I overthinking this? What do you think about it having  experience in your field? ( Or as  parent yourself)

Edit:  I wanted to add that this is not a professional Nanny. She is a mother  in her 40s, her children are leaving for college and she is looking to  start nannying.

850,"This is more of a rant post, but we started potty training today. I’m trying to stay positive and upbeat though if I’m being honest, I’ve been dreading this day for weeks now. I know this is going to take a lot of time but we’ve been pretty spoiled with our daughter so far. She started sleeping through the night on her own without any fuss by 1.5/2 months old. She learned to walk on her own at 9 months. Started saying recognizable words shortly after. Everything so far has just come so easy to her. 

I was really hoping potty training would be the same way. I know it’s ridiculous to think she’d nail it after half a day. I really do. But so far she’s peed 6 times on the floor and we’ve managed to get one whole DROP into the toilet. She’s so quick that by the time I get to her, even standing two feet away, she’s already done peeing. And when she pees on the floor, she likes trying to splash in it like she just discovered she can literally make her own water park. Not a good sign!

* they provide 70 prefolds/week and 2 pail liners

* cloth wipes service included ( I am not convinced I will want to use CWs when we graduate to 'real food' poops so I'll just try this out for now and see how it goes)

2) 6 covers

3) 12 prefolds for just in case situations


question: should I get doublers or liners for this stage? if yes I was thinking 6 hemp, 6 bamboo. Is that enough to take me through the next stage?

1)  3 pail liners and 3 wet/dry bags


2)  I've been given about 100 wipes/face cloths so I think I'll be fine for any poopocalyps 


3) still using the covers from the first month 


4) add 12 AMP NB Fitteds


5) 3 Grovia KPs


6) 3 Freetimes


7) 3 Sweet pea AIOs 


7) Depending on advice from here 6 hemp, 6 bamboo inserts/doublers


**Month 3- through to Potty Training** 

1) Still using covers/replacing as needed for sizing


2) Add 12 Sweet pea AIOs (Sized from 10lbs-35lbs)

We felt obligated to let out daughter participate. Here is my mistake, I should have asked the type of ceremony we would be participating in, my mistake and I feel VERY bad about this.

It was like someone drug my daughter into a strip club and left her there alone for 30 minutes.

My family has had some very negative experiences with theists over the years. We usually simply ignore everything ‘god(no particular one, just all)’ related. My family goes to such extremes to not let her play with religious families/kids, we simply feel they are a bad influence. I know my daughter will be faced with challenges growing up where she will be tempted and I want to prep her for this. How can I be a better dad?

I’m trying to play damage control after our wedding experience. Are there any parents that could assist me with bringing up the topic with her? Should I wait till she asked questions about god/gods/whatever? Or should I be proactive? How do I convey my belief system without sounding incredibly cynical, angry, and jaded? In my mind theism isn’t any more of a choice than if you would walk off a building or not.

Are there any books you could suggest about convincing my daughter theist have something to offer even if they follow things that don’t make sense?

I'm in a town I hate and would preferably like to blow up given half a chance, I'm over an hour away from my friends, I'm home with the little one all day other than her in preschool for a few hours in the morning, my other half doesn't get home till 8pm and right now I'm working 3 nights of the week and don't get home till after 10 and working Saturday mornings too. 

I never wanted kids to begin with (but that's a different story lol), I spend most of my life helping out at home and being there for my sisters and was waiting till the youngest one turned 18 and didn't need me quite as much anymore. Now I'm just stuck and trapped for another decade +.

Short back story, she and I dated for about 8 months. It ended with me getting yelled at a lot for, basically, not being who she thought I was. I enjoy my job, check my history if you want to see what I do, and I put in some long hours. I work in private sector and handle things when the owner of my company needs. I’ve always been that right hand kind of guy and throughout every job I’ve had, I’ve always ended up in that position. She is a white collar state worker and has never worked an hour of overtime in her life. She would loose her mind if my boss called on a Saturday to discuss the ideas of changing a part design or wanted me to come in on a Sunday for a few hours to help mock up some new products. Working 12+ hour days was normal and I’m compensated well enough for it. I grew up in a house where my father worked the same way i do to provide a good life for his family. If we struggled, i never knew. She couldn’t take it and she left. 

I get it, I really do. 

I never wanted a kid, it’s just not something i ever thought would be part of my life. She knew that. When we discussed birth control, it was more of a casual conversation of whether *certain* bedroom things were ok, I assumed that her saying yes meant that she was on some form of birth control. I assumed wrong, apparently. 

After splitting up, we had dropped all contact. No reason to communicate with someone who just wants to yell. I met my current girlfriend and we have been together for a year and a half. On Saturday morning the X told me I had a child, out of the blue, by complete surprise, by text. 

The Girlfriend is mad, mad at me for being dumb enough to get a girl pregnant, mad at the X for keeping this from me for so long. The GF just took a different job offer to give us a ton more time together, she supports me and I support her, emotionally, not monetarily. 

Today I went and met my child. Beautiful healthy blonde hair blue eyed girl. 

My heart felt empty. 

I couldn’t get past the anger I had for her mother. I didn’t speak, for an hour and a half, I sat on the couch and watched her play with her toys on the floor. I felt so... unattached. And I got up and left. I came home, to my house, and sat on the floor with my 8 month old puppy and hugged him and gave him treats and talked to him like I should probably have talked to my daughter. 

I guess what I’m looking for is, are there other guys out there like me? Is that emotion something that comes with time? She is well-off and isn’t looking for my money, I’m not listed on the birth certificate, she said I can be involved at whatever, if any, capacity that I wish.

893,"We don't have much of a routine yet and my supply is very limited (currently unable to feed her solely on breast milk, so I still have yet to be able to make a stash). I try to pump exclusively, because of personal reasons and my over-active letdown is just a pain in the butt. I still breast feed when she wakes up at night to feed, but she never drinks that much at night anyways. So because of this, I supplement with formula very randomly. If I can only pump 2 oz between feedings, I'll add in formula to make up for the rest. Sometimes she just gets a full formula bottle. More often than not, I am able to barely make enough and she is content with it. She will have no more than 6 oz a day of formula (Enfamil newborn), and sometimes I am able to go a whole day without needing formula.

Is the random introductions of formula sporadically detrimental to her in any way?
Oh and any tips on EP would be appreciated. I can only pump 2-4 oz max at a time, and she's been eating 3.5-4 oz every 2-4 hours.

The very short story is that he had been in the nicu until yesterday when the doctors all agreed that his stats were all good, except for his feeding by mouth. He was moved to another wing where he would still be monitored and we could work on his feeding. His issue is that he is very tired all of the time because of the heart condition, and every time we try feeding him by breast or bottle he starts off ok, but then falls asleep because of how much it takes out of him. We have been very diligent about trying every 3 hrs. Some times are better than others, but his progress has been very slow. We are trying to keep a positive attitude towards things as we are excited to get him home, only after he is ready of course. 

One of the nurses in this new wing came in and told my wife that he will probably be like this until after the surgery. That took the wind right out of my wife’s sails.

My big uncertainty is traveling with the large stroller: We're planning to bring our baby jogger city select with car seats and glider board through security and then gate-check it. We're flying with Delta, and per their website it looks like this should be fine. I'm planning to remove the car seat adapters and put them in my carry on before gate-checking, since they (1) look fragile compared to the stroller frame and (2) are small and easy to remove anyway. I looked into a travel bag for the stroller, but it's $80-90 which seems excessive- does anyone have one, was it worth the money? Has anyone had issues gate-checking a large (but foldable) stroller and two car seats, do we need to scrap the idea and look into a double umbrella stroller? We like this plan because it will make getting through airports much easier and means we only have to rent one car seat (convertible seat for the toddler) instead of three at our destination.

We managed to get a direct flight and it’s only about 2.5hrs, so even if it’s a hot mess it won’t be for long. My husband and I will carry the twins as lap children (5 tickets would be prohibitively expensive). The plane we'll be on has 2 seats on each side of the aisle, so there will be one adult and one baby next to our toddler and the other adult+baby just across the aisle. I picked seats in the second-to-last row, based on past travels with the toddler the back of the plane seems to be a good and socially-acceptable place for small children. Our 3yo is a pro at entertaining himself and has traveled well in the past, as long as I bring enough stuff to read and color I’m pretty sure he’ll be fine.

Our first birth was successful (in terms of we got a healthy baby) yet traumatic,  leaving my wife with a 3C tear and shaking our trust in the doctors and midwives. Details at the end of the post about that.

We're not planning on having another pregnancy so the main trade off seems to be between causing permanent damage and side effects to the tear, versus the risks and recovery involved in the major surgery that is c-section.

This birth will be at a different hospital (Barnet).

Our first son is will be 2 soon so will the additional recovery time mean my wife cant pick him up for longer?

And through all this we aware that no matter what we decide, unforeseen events or even just different staff on shift may mean that we end up with the other option anyway, but it seems best to have a plan.

Details on first birth:
Our plan was to give birth in the birth centre with as little intervention as possible but Baby was happy where he was and  so the midwives encouraged us to be induced,  with the reassurance that we could still go into the birth centre. In the end the doctors overruled that and we had to go to the ward instead. Also during all this my wife had no pain relief until she was fully dilated (thank god for hypnobirthing methods). There was also a episiotomy performed that we didnt know about until afterwards,  which may have contributed to the tear (or prevented worse tearing,  no one knows).",True,child behavior problem

We've given him underwear so he feels the mess he makes. But all of this to say, after the first day, there are no accidents. He holds it until nap time. And then holds it until bedtime. It goes like this: 

day 1- small accidents, holding mostly, very wet diapers at nap and when he wakes up the next morning.

Day 2- holds it, but generally we will get one or two pees into the potty. When he's successful we celebrate and he gets a piece of chocolate.

Day 3- nothing at all. He will hold it. He will show signs of needing to go. He is happy to sit on the potty but will do nothing. And through all of this, especially by the end of the day he is miserable, clingy, and squirming. We get him to sit, he will not go. And it was usually by this time that we would quit because he was just so miserable and we become concerned about holding so much. Last night he peed in the bath and knew he did it and exclaimed ""I did it!"" and he became concerned with farting thinking he was going to have an accident. He also at bedtime pooped in his diaper after a few times coming out to tell us he needed the potty and we helped him and he did nothing until he was half asleep and then he came to get us. 

This time we're on day 4 and it's the same as day 3. Miserable. Holding. Squirming around. He successfully tells us he has to go and we direct him to the potty and he pulls his underwear down and will sit and do nothing. We play, read books, sing songs, Elmo will call. Or we sit and watch his favorite show. He will sit for 15-20 mins and do nothing in the potty.

What do we do? He's the only one in his mother's day out class that isn't potty trained. They've been understanding because he's the youngest (and probably shouldn't have moved up quite yet) but I know they're getting tired of changing diapers. And frankly so am I.

I work in Special Education, and have discussed it with my boss who has a doctorate in children’s psychology and special education. He doesn’t seem too worried about it, and believes it to be an attention seeking tactic, or an attempt to get his way after being told no. His advice was to redirect the hands, and provide positive reinforcement. 
I have been trying to worry less about it, but lately he has switched from lightly hitting himself to hitting himself super hard. And to top it off, this morning I quietly peeked into his room while he was sleeping to check on him, and he was doing it in his sleep! 
He has never been exposed to violence, and is so happy all the time. My husband and I never fight, we don’t even really bicker at each other, so I don’t understand where this is coming from. 
It breaks my heart to see my son do something like that to himself, I just want him to stop!

949,"[Hi everyone, this is Leo!](https://imgur.com/a/tovCr)

My nephew was born with Down Syndrome. I'd like to tell you a little about his story so far. Leo was born a little earlier than we expected on 02/09/2015 to my sister Lora and her husband Brendon. He is named after his grandfather. They waited on the sex, but I kind of felt like it was gonna be a boy. 

Needless to say, his coming really shocked me. First I hear was ""in labor"" then a picture of him saying ""Welcome your nephew, Leo Aaron, to the world"". 

I immediately started crying, as my names Aaron. I've never had a greater honor in my life. And I was so excited. I had so many plans for him. Parents almost get the luxury of just praying for a healthy baby. Not me. Of course I wanted him healthy, but I was so excited about teaching him hockey, about showing him the right way to skate. I constantly said he'd be an NHL player. 

I'm ashamed to say when my sister told me he had Downs, it broke my heart. I was scared, depressed and heartbroken thinking he would not have a good life. 

I was uneducated, ignorant and so, so wrong. 

Almost in spite of me, he's been truly a blessing in my life and everyone he meets. He's always happy. He's always smiling. Even the first time I saw him after he required heart surgery, he looked happy. His absolute favorite thing is vibrating his lips. His grandmother is to blame for that, and he adores his mother. 

DS has opened my eyes to how amazing people can be, and how inspiring we can be to others. 

My sister led me to this incredible site that makes me actually hopeful for his future. It's a charity called Rubys Rainbow. And it's just a beautiful idea of further making DS more accessible to the general public. 

[Here is a link to his page](https://321pledge.org/d/dcb46fc0/). I don't expect anyone to donate, but I thought with our holiday coming up, if anyone was looking for something to work with, it's as great a story as any.

970,"tl:dr - toddler declares war on sleep.
So, my 26 month old boy over the weekend decided that he didn't want to sleep anymore after he discovered he could easily crawl out of the crib. He even ended up with a bloody bottom lip at one point. So, after trying to keep in him in the crib for a night or two (failure...), my wife and I decided that last would be the best time to turn the convertible crib into a toddler bed. We did everything you were supposed to do - filled the bed with blankets and stuffed animals, read to him in the bed instead of the rocking chair like we normally and talked up the fact that he's a big boy in his big boy bed. But as soon as we walked out the door, he started wailing, jumped out of the bed (or even just running out of the bed and falling on his face) and heading straight for the door. Eventually he started crying uncontrollably. A bit of a backstory - my wife just gave my birth a month ago to an awesome little girl, but she had a really rough pregnancy so in the last several months I've done everything - put him to bed, feed him, wake him, etc. In that time he's grown really attached to me. Now that my wife is back to her wonderful self, she's doing a lot more - but he still wants me all the time. Also, he's a very stubborn and emotional kid - if he doesn't get something he wants he will scream and yell and even hurt himself. He's been known to bite down on his had really hard leave bite marks And slam his head against the door continuously when I'm in the bedroom changing or the bathroom. Back to last night - We tried keeping him in the room for a few minutes and not letting him leave, thinking that he would wear himself out and get into bed. All he did was hit his head against the door over and over again. So my wife (trying to wean him off of me) rocked him until he slept and stayed by his bed for an hour until he was asleep enough for her to leave. Before we kept him in the room we tried silently placing him in his bed every time he tried to leave his room but after about 30 minutes of that he was so emotional we just rocked him. With separation anxiety this bad, we have no idea what to do. With the newborn we are barely getting enough sleep as it is, I have a crazy commute and am almost falling asleep On the way to work, and my wife is still on maternity leave and so tired we don't know what to do. Crazy thing is, up until a week or so ago (a few weeks after the baby was born) all we had to do is kiss him and place him in the crib and he wouldn't make a peep for 12 hours. Any tips? I fully know that this might take a little while to fix, but everything I'm reading is saying stuff like ""when he gets out of his bed to play put him back in"" but he's not playing. He's panicking.

971,"tl:dr Korean adoption has many serious issues, how do we address them. 

Hi there, I am a transnational adoptee that has been on this sub for quite some time.  I respond to many of you through pm on my main account and have read virtually everything posted on this sub.  I guess I just wanted to just get some stuff out there I've been thinking about in regards to my adoption and some of the information I've learned about the adoption process in Korea.  I spent my whole life feeling like I was unwanted and unlovable  I was angry at my birth mother for giving up on me, and even more so I was angry at myself for not being good enough for the one person who was supposed to love me unconditionally.  I listened to my mother tell me about how much my birth mother loved me, because she carried me to full term and placed me into adoption so I would have the best upbringing possible.  But I never could accept this, how could it mean she loved me when she got rid of me? It just didn't compute.  I listened to my mother talk about the shame of being unmarried with a baby.  And I internalized it as, my existence was shameful for her, I was shameful just being alive. I've struggled my whole life trying to figure out where I fit in, never Asian enough for the handful of asians I knew, and never white enough for the people I grew up around.  I felt so isolated.  I desperately would like a reunion or some sort of information on my birth family, but the language barrier restricts much of the searching I'd be able to do were it a domestic adoption.  The information I have on my birth parents is incredibly generic, basically their ages is all I know, and leaves a lot of questions.  So I've been researching.  Researching the culture, researching the adoption process, trying to find any information I can to help bring me some answers. What I found was that the more I find out, the more I feel like I can understand what my mother was trying to tell me all these years and the more I can begin to understand the struggles and courage my birth mother had by having me. 

So to begin, a not so little history of adoption in Korea. Korean adoption began in the 50s after the Korean War.  At the time, many US soldiers impregnated Korean women and after their tour, left to return to the states.  The result was mixed race babies with no father figure left in a very patriarchal society.  North Korea at the time used these babies as fodder for pr for their cause, stating these mixed race babies were physical proof that America was trying to colonize Korea.  The S. Korean government deemed that the best solution for everyone would be to send the babies to their fatherland.  Back in America, humanitarian groups took up the effort and ads were placed in the newspaper with headlines such as ""a Korean baby for you"" - insert picture of cute Korean baby.  Korean baby adoption rates soared up until the 80s, when S. Korea began getting bad publicity for its high adoption rate.  It was looked at as a heavy baby exportation place and so limits were placed on the number of babies they were able to adopt out internationally.  Today the number is around 1000 children a year, compared to the 80s when it was about 8000 children/yr.  This adoption restriction made it so there is an increasing amount of children left to age out of the system.  There is no support for these children, in terms of social programs or societal support. At the beginning of Korean adoptions, the reason stated for placement was largely abandonment or broken families.  In today's society, a large amount of these babies put up for adoption are from a) a poor family who cannot afford to care for their child, who use orphanages as something of a day care, or b) single mothers.  I had grown up wondering why there was such a high abandonment rate of children in Korea, in a country that states that it is in a population decline and not producing enough to sustain itself.  Why abandonment was so prevalent they established baby boxes as a safe way to anonymously surrender your baby. I think the answer to this lies in understanding a little about Korean culture and lack of support for struggling families/single mothers. In Korean culture, while many look at the country as an advanced modernized society, it still remains a very traditional patriarchal society with family honor at the root of it. Even in this day and age, unwed mothers are a very taboo thing over there.  In America, divorce and single mothers are things that can be openly discussed, there is support of sorts to these women in the form of social programs and it is not that abnormal to see someone in that situation.  In Korea, being an unwed mother means the women face discrimination severe enough that she could lose her job, her home, and her family connections.  It is not unusual for people, friends, coworkers and family alike to cut off all ties with the women in fear they would be associated with the huge dishonor with having a baby out of wedlock. It is not unusual for a women to get kicked out by her landlord for having this baby out of wedlock.  It is not unusual for a company to fire a women for having/keeping this baby.  Did you know that when you apply for a job in Korea you are required to submit your family history?  And that it is not unusual in Korea to turn down a woman for a job because of the absence of the father. As far as social support for the women, if they can prove they are below the poverty line, they are eligible for about the equivalent of $70 American dollars a month from the government. Which is low even in Korea.  But did you know that when they determine if you're eligible for this, they factor in the worth of your home, your car and your possessions?  They factor in the income of your family, even though a good amount of these women were disowned by said family and that income is not a realistic part of what will contribute to the baby's rearing.  If your parents make good money, you are pretty much ineligible for the help.  Families that are struggling to raise their child are not eligible for this support at all. Did you also know that Korean families looking to adopt are eligible for ~$150 American dollars a month for adopting a Korean baby?  Regardless of income, they get double of what the government would provide for a mother who wishes to keep her child. As far as child support, it is required that the father pay child support in Korea.  But strangely enough, if the father wishes to detach and not fulfill this obligation, all he has to do is not fill out the paperwork stating he is the child's father.  He is no longer legally required to help the child in any way and the mother's paperwork alone stating he is the father is not sufficient enough to receive the support. The Ministry of Health in 2007 put out a statistic stating that out of every 100 unwed women in Korea, it is estimated that 96% of them will have abortions, 3% will surrender to adoption and only 1% will try and raise the baby.  This is a country where abortion is illegal, yet an overwhelming majority of unwed mothers opt for this because of social stigma and lack of support.  In the entire country of around 50 million people, there are only 33 programs to help unwed mothers.  But the vast majority of these are run BY adoption agencies, so oftentimes the women spends the time there being talked into why she should adopt her baby out and not how they can help her keep the baby.  It is a major conflict of interest.  These agencies get paid roughly $20,000 per internationally adopted baby while a domestic adoption will net them $4,000.   They encourage the mother to opt for international adoption so the baby will have more opportunity and not have to face the confusion of potentially seeing his/her birth mother on the subway. They tell her their children will not face discrimination if they send them away the way they would if they kept them. So what is the solution?  How can you fix the way society treats someone, a society which I am pretty detached from already.  How can we encourage a society to be more supportive of struggling families and single mothers? The adoption agencies are in the wrong to coerce a vulnerable mother into surrendering her baby while pretending to offer support, society is wrong for the way they treat these women and their children.  But saying international adoption is terrible and discouraging it only hurts the children who are already there, as seen by the international adoption restrictions already placed on the country and the rising amount of children who age out and are left to society with nothing. What is the right solution? I would love to hear some prospective from you guys. I try and support this movement by sending money to KUMFA, a Korean organization that supports single mothers, not associated with any adoption agency and founded by a woman who tried to place her baby and fought to get him back.  I try and inform adoptive parents of what my experiences were growing up as a transnational adoptee so they are better equipped to help their child deal with issues they may experience.  But it all feels like it's not big enough to make a lasting impact on the real issue.  What else can we do to help the situation?",True,emotion coaching

This is one of the few verses that is found in the Bible relating to parenting. On some of the commentary it states that you should train them to follow the Word of God and teach them Godly precepts.

But could it mean more?

When my youngest son was in elementary school he had a difficulty learning how to read. I tutored him every day and made sure he did his homework before he was allowed to play. Yet he struggled with learning the alphabet because they were teaching phonics and he was more suited for whole word learning.[https://singleparentssurvivalguide.com/phonics-is-it-the-best-way-to-teach-reading/](https://singleparentssurvivalguide.com/phonics-is-it-the-best-way-to-teach-reading/)

I can remember the day when his kindergarten teacher started teaching math. She literally was exploding with joy when she told me that he was a wiz at math!

Considering I am an author and also a very successful blogger I could have shamed him for his difficulty with reading. I could have pushed him into something which he had no desire for. I chose not to be like my mother in that aspect. I chose to encourage and support him in his reading and stand in awe of him for his genius in math.

He has now graduated from engineering school and has a job offer which far surpasses anything I have ever been offered coming right out of college.

I think that the Bible may mean more than just teaching your child the Word of God. I believe it may mean to acknowledge the gifts which your children have been given from God and support them in every way possible.
