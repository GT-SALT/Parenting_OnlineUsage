6,"(Cross post from r/TwoXChromosomes! Also, this might be TMI for some people and long so apologies!!) Hi guys. I'm in a weird predicament. I've been on Nexplanon for about 5 years now, I've had my second one for a year. I never had a regular period until a few months ago, when I randomly got hit with one. I was really confused, but that can happen, so I didn't think much of it.

I got it again a few weeks later, so I assumed I was just on a regular cycle again. Then I started getting weird discharge, it looked like ovulation discharge, which I hadn't had before. Then some weird brown discharge, so I chocked it up to spotting because that's a side effect. My sex drive skyrocketed, so my boyfriend and I were having sex nearly every day, sometimes a few times a day.

Then a few weeks before my next expected period, I started feeling... off. I got hit with this huge wave of fatigue that hasn't subsided in weeks. Nausea also set in. Yesterday I woke up and promptly ran to the bathroom to vomit--which was a red flag to me, I'm never nauseous and never vomit unless extremely drunk. I drank a coffee, which I normally drink every day, and was disgusted by it. I've been vomiting somewhat regularly these past two weeks, and I also just thought it could be PMS. I've never had this severe of PMS before.

I have noticed I'm always uncomfortably hot, while no one else is. I wake up very hot and nauseous, whereas my boyfriend and everyone else seem fine. A few days ago, my nausea got even worse by the heat, and my friends and I stepped into an Antique store, and the smell of the store was so nausea-inducing, I had to sit outside and wait for my friends. My smell is so sensitive, I can't drink coffee without wanting to vomit which is SUPER weird because I drink multiple cups of coffee a day normally. I have had a strange craving for sushi lately? I go out of my way to eat it as much as I can. My boobs have gone up 2 cup sizes, which also could be PMS, but they're bigger than normal. I also got these weird bumps on my nipples, which I investigated and turns out they're Montgomery tubercles, which usually are a sign of pregnancy. I had stuff coming out of them, too, which apparently is for lubricating the nipple for a baby?!

(I swear I'm almost done) So then I started getting concerned. I did some research, looking up symptoms, and I have every single early pregnancy symptom. It's difficult because PMS can mimic those symptoms, but the nipple changes seem very similar to those of pregnant women... I've talked to my mom and told her all this, and she thinks I could be pregnant. But the probability is SO slim, that I still am unsure. There's a .03% chance I'm pregnant. Less than 1 in 100 women get pregnant. But then I learned that the medication I take actually LOWERS the efficacy of birth control! Wtf! So now, I'm waiting for my period, which should be coming any day now. I'm just so confused, I've never felt this way before, and never THIS long. If I'm not pregnant, then could this just be weirdly severe PMS? I'm planning on waiting a week or two to take a pregnancy test if I miss my period so it is more accurate. I'm just concerned, because if I'm not pregnant, then what is happening to my body?

Thanks for reading! Have a great day!!",False,
7,"***Tl;dr: Daycare has asked my son to leave despite not giving us any warning and even telling us he was not in danger of being kicked out. They're unwilling to allow him to work with Child Find and have totally written him off.*** 

[After posting this](https://redd.it/dl417q) I tried to implement a few of the strategies suggest, specifically allowing him to take a lovey to school the hold if he got upset or excited. A few of the other ideas, like a reward system or the like were shot down by the school. They didn't want to participate in anything that would seem like he was getting something the other kids weren't. 

He had two good days in a row, but by Friday they asked him to leave. Here's the timeline and how it worked out for us. 

* 9/25: I ran into the owner at the center and told her I was getting concerned because I noticed he had a lot of frowny faces on his daily report, she expressed that he was indeed struggling and she was getting frustrated because ""he wanted to do, what he wanted to do, when he wanted to do it"". I was a little shocked because this was the first time hearing this. All other conversations were summed up as ""he's three, he had a rough day but this is normal stuff""
* 9/26: I emailed her the very next day and asked for a sit-down with him and his actual teacher who wasn't there when I was casually speaking with the owner. 
* 9/27: I sat down with the owner and teacher and they shared that he's not listening well, he's not malicious, but has trouble keeping his hands to himself and doesn't always listen when instructed. The owner asked the teacher if she thought he could benefit from Child Find (a program for early intervention). The teacher said yes. **I asked if she was considering asking him to leave and she said no, that he's not to that level and if he were she would be having conversations with me to let me know before she asked him to leave**
* 9/28: they give me paperwork for program and I call the pediatrician to schedule an appointment to get their thoughts. 
* 10/7: Meet w/ pediatrician, said he scores hight on the ADD/ADHD test, but he's 3.5 so too early to make a formal Dx. Might grow out of it, said Child Find can't hurt
* 10/7: Submitted paperwork for Child Find
* 10/14: Spoke w/ his teacher, said he was still struggling but was looking forward to Child Find helping, said there's other things to try if that doesn't work. **Also said he was not in danger of being asked to leave, I specifically asked**
* 10/21: Posted to you lovely parents to ask for advice
* Week of 10/21 he continues to struggle but had two good days and this felt like progress to me. 
* 10/25: Owner calls me during the lunch hour and says he's not a fit and should find somewhere new. I was very upset and we hung up. I called Child Find and told them it was important someone can immediately to help us, they agreed to put him in the front of the line and scheduled the visit for Monday. I called daycare back and asked if they could please give him a chance to work with Child Find before asking him to leave, especially considering they have given him no warning and ALL of the conversations were initiated by me. Also, both im and the teacher assured me he was in no danger of being asked to leave. She said no, he can stay until I find a new place, but he's not a good fit. 

Overall, I don't want my son to be somewhere he's not wanted, so I know it's better that we leave. I'm heartbroken because he's been there since he was 14 weeks old, as has been my daughter who is 1.5 and very shy. It'll be so hard for her to leave her teacher, whom she loves, and go somewhere else. I can't see leaving her there, though, considering the way they're handling this. 

I am more angry they're not giving him a chance and that all of this seems to have stemmed from ME initiating the conversation. I feel like had I not said anything he's still be there. It hurts that they've had him since he was a baby and are just so cavalierly letting him leave, it makes me feel like they never cared for him anyway, which breaks my heart.

10,"*TL;DR We went through a family crisis at the end of last year and my son got a D in almost every class. He's applying early action to his first choice college and thanks to bureaucracy those are the most recent grades the college will be able to see. His guidance counselor refuses to clarify the reason for the poor grades anywhere in the common application and we don't know how to explain it to the school or convince her to cooperate.*


My son is applying to his first choice college early decision. It's not Harvard or anywhere in that bracket, but admission isn't guaranteed by any means (about 45% rate). 

For parents who haven't been through the 7th circle of hell known in layman terms as The Common App, a lot of your kid's future rests in the hands of your kid's guidance counselor at school. They are a required letter of recommendation and they also submit an essay of up to a thousand words about your child (for better or worse) to explain any anomalies in their file or tip off colleges about a problem student. 

My son's guidance counselor has only met him three times in four years - he's in a class of 1500 kids and I think this counselor is responsible for about 250 of them. 

Our dilemma is getting her to clarify somewhere on the app about my son's grades. My husband was diagnosed with a genetic condition that left him with about a year to live. (Thanks to seeking a third opinion it was discovered to be a rare and burdensome but **completely manageable** condition with which he can live a long and relatively healthy life with ongoing treatment.) Needless to say this was an incomprehensibly stressful time for the entire family, especially the kids. 

Our son has all D's and one B for the second semester of his Junior year (the school couldn't have been any less accommodating to our situation.) We would like the guidance counselor to add a note explaining the situation (he's an A-B student in every other semester and currently on honor roll this semester.) But because he's applying early action and won't receive a midterm report until Thanksgiving, the bad grades will be the most recent ones colleges see. 

We've had a phone call with the guidance counselor, who says it's not her place to justify our son's bad grades, and that ""Frankly it doesn't reflect well on his ability to cope with his studies under personal pressure."" She basically insinuated we made up the illness to cover for him. 

It definitely doesn't help that I came unhinged over the phone when I realized what she was implying. 

We're at a loss as to what to do. We've sent her the medical records, the physician who got very close to our family this past year, has even offered to call and confirm the events and that he saw our son sitting by his dad's bedside through every hospital visit, desolate. 

We were late to start looking at and visiting colleges dealing with my husband's declining health. We have got a week left to get this sorted before the submission deadline (had we had any clue they'd resist at all we would have gone in sooner.) The counselor is now refusing to meet with us in person because we we are only just now setting up a meeting and so many kids are applying to college on the same deadline. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to maybe circumvent the counselor or work it into the application somewhere on our end? The college doesn't have any short answer questions, and he tried to work it into his essay but the whole ordeal is still too raw for him.",False,

17,"39+5, impatiently waiting.

We have a close couple of friends who conceived not long after we did. Their due date was about a week after ours (ours is on Thursday but I've no delusions). However, whereas my wife's pregnancy has been extremely text-book and devoid of complications, theirs has had a number of concerns. Low fluid, underdeveloped at first, not enough movement, etc. I wouldn't say it was ""touch and go"" but they've been on edge for months now because the doctors kept finding new things to be mildly worried about.

Doctors decided to induce our friend today, purely because they're in a good spot and don't want to wait for something to go wrong before inducing. So they're really happy for their wait to be over and to not have to worry about pregnancy complications anymore. We're really happy for them (if a little jealous; wife is **done** being pregnant).

However... their kid is going to be technically older than our kid. Probably by a week or more. Their birthday is going to come before ours, even though our child was conceived weeks before theirs. Our child has been developing and ""existing"" for longer, yet on paper their child is going to be ""older"".

It just sort of hit me last night how arbitrary ""age"" is. We just decided somewhere along the way that the day the kid pops out is the day we start counting, no matter how long they've been gestating. It doesn't bother me at all, I just realised I'd never thought about it before and it was suddenly really weird to me.

Anyhoo, this is a shitpost because I'm bored of waiting. Any day now, right? We have a baby-pool going and I have $5 each on both their baby *and* our baby being born on the 9th of May - so I lost their date because they cheated :P I've never wanted to lose a bet more than I do right now, because I want our kid to show up ***today***. Like, right freaking now. I'm done, this wait is killing me. Get here, kiddo. I've been yelling at my wife's belly every morning for a week in the hopes he gets the hint (as well as some of the more... fun recommendations on how to induce labour).

20,"4 months ago, I moved out of my parent’s house because of Domestic assault from both my parents. Now, they’re talking to me again but I feel strange about the idea of going home for Christmas and New Year’s. 

There’s a few points that I want to share with you for more context: 

1. I have never gotten beat up so bad by them in my whole life. Although I will acknowledge that my dad has anger issues. My mom doesn’t though, and that’s what broke my heart - is that she was part of physically hurting me at that time. 

2. The reason this happened was because I told them I wanted to live in with my boyfriend for college. They were strongly against (being an Asian family and all) it but I stood my ground and said it’s what I feel best for financial reasons and honestly for my mental health while being in my last year of studies. I wasn’t necessarily asking for permission as I’m 22, they don’t support me financially in any way either for my schooling, and I only come home for summer break. I just wanted to be honest to them since it’s a big step in my life that I’m doing. 

3. My parents aren’t the biggest fan of my boyfriend because of social status, how he’s not the smartest person academically, and his mom used to be friends with my parents but something happened that we as a couple weren’t even involved in. My parents have always tried to butt in every fight of our relationship and gaslight my boyfriend about making me cry. But they don’t know what our relationship is about, they just assume he’s the worst person ever.

So last August the night that happened, we were having a discussion on the table, my dad slapped me because I said no when he told me to stay away from my boyfriend and I told him I’m gonna call the cops for hurting me. That’s when they both started to tackle me. My parents beat my head, dragged me to the floor, pushed me on the couch, blocked my way when I was trying to escape. I remember my dad hitting my eye over and over again and choking me. They wanted to take my phone because I said I was gonna call the cops. So my mom took it and messaged my boyfriend’s family despicable things and wanted them to come down and have a “talk.” My parents sent my brother to their apartment to get him but his mom was so scared he’d also get hurt so she blocked his way. My boyfriend was so mad he wanted to come but he literally just got out of the hospital too because he was feeling something earlier that day. My mom was calling him but my boyfriend’s mom took the phone to protect him from going to my place so that time I thought I wasn’t gonna get rescue. I was bleeding and swelling all over my face. They tried to brainwash me and said he doesn’t even care enough about me to come and save me. 

The only people in the house to see what happened was my two brothers (19 and 10), and my youngest brother was just silent in his room while all that was going on in the living room. I literally thought I was gonna die that day. I was so scared for my life I just wanted to go somewhere else. So my parents had my phone, and they tried to lock me in my room. I had to find a way to get to the cops so I secretly turned on my computer and looked for the police landline but the computer couldn’t make calls. I felt so helpless. So then I snuck to my youngest brother’s room because I remembered he had his iPad with him. Thank God snapchat logs out of your phone when it logs in to another so they couldn’t see my messages. They had my phone so I couldn’t log in to Facebook. So I called a friend on snapchat and showed him my bleeding face and asked him to get the police for me. My youngest brother looks like he knows what was going on and I couldn’t help but cry because I don’t know if he’ll remember this when he grows up. A few minutes later the cops came and I just told them to take me away but I don’t want them to charge or arrest my parents. I knew what was going to happen to my siblings if they lose my parents. 

So anyways, I was in the shelter for a day because I didn’t want to go to a friend’s. I got my phone back. I could’ve stayed for a month there but my boyfriend’s mom wanted me to stay with them for my safety. That night I was brought to the shelter I got a text from my mom basically endings things with me as part of the family. And another one from my 19yr old brother blaming me for breaking up the family just because I picked a guy. I have a younger sister who’s always pretty stoic about everything. The hardest part was not having a friend in her when all this was happening. She said she’s not taking sides and just hope I’m okay wherever I am. She mostly cares about her wellbeing and who’s gonna take care of her since she’s only 16. 

My parents didn’t know where I was for a month even though I was only staying blocks away from our house. I went back to my summer job after a week of rest (I let them know I got into a bad situation and needed physical rest), but I would avoid being seen outside because I was so scared I’d bump into them or somebody might find out what happened. I always wore hoodies when I go out or mostly stay inside the whole day because it was such a small neighborhood. I tried hanging out with my youngest brother once and got him ice cream outside, then I was threatened that they would call the police if I take my brother out again. I was never allowed to call him on the phone or chat with him. I developed PTSD and dreamt about my parents almost every day. It doesn’t happen anymore but I still get panic attacks when I think about what happened. I cried everyday for a month to the point my boyfriend was getting mad at me too because I still blame myself for what happened. I just wasn’t used to having a broken family. 

But now I’m back to school in college and I’m now actually living with my boyfriend and everything’s been good ever since. We talk to his mom on the phone all the time. I basically tried to move on from what happened with my parents. I tried making a new Facebook account to start new, but I never got around setting it up. My mom would tag me in family pictures of them eating in a restaurant, videos of my youngest brother (I’m closes to him), events at home while I’m away. Always happy, always perfect. I just wasn’t on the pictures. It just looked like I was away for school like everybody knows. But I haven’t spoken to them ever since. And then a couple of months ago, my dad was brought to the hospital due to gallbladder complications. My dad is getting old so I couldn’t bring myself to ignore it so I texted my mom to ask how he’s holding up. I do miss them. We weren’t always a “bad” family. When it’s good, it’s good. They were proud of me for being the smartest, most independent, etc. But it gets really bad too. I tend to disappoint them with some of my decisions. So anyways, I wasn’t waiting for a text from my dad but he eventually did and said he missed me. 

He never said sorry verbally though. Ever since, he’s always calling me and asking about my day, always asking me what to do with his new business ideas (my dad’s a workaholic). He never asked about my boyfriend anymore and never acknowledged what happened before I left. It was like normal again. He mostly calls me about his work, his business... I can now talk to my younger brother though. I’ve FaceTimed him once or twice and he seems to be the happy little kid he’s always been. 

And then the holidays got brought up. I never celebrated Christmas without my family. My dad asked when is Christmas break and just assumed I’ll be going home like always. I also just encountered this strange feeling of not knowing what to do. Since he never said sorry, even my mom. We just started talking. I’ve never talked to my older brother ever since what he said to me. Even my younger sister. So going home would be so strange to me. I don’t even know if I want to come home but at the same time there’s nothing for me in this town where I’m studying. My boyfriend is going home too, but if my parents find out I’m spending Christmas over at another family’s I don’t know how they would react especially because my boyfriend lives in the same town as I do. He says he’ll support me no matter where I spend Christmas as long as I’m safe. But also I don’t want to feel left out when I’m home. I feel like a lot has already happened that I wasn’t a part of as a family member. And I’m too uncomfortable knowing that I was hurt inside my own home. Our Christmases the last couples of years hasn’t been good either. The best Christmas we’ve had in years was 2018’s and that could change this year.

I spent the evening in quite a lot of pain and we thought I was going to go into labour properly. Around 1am the contractions faded away. The Foley bulb had probably fallen out but was still in my vagina. I got some sleep.

I woke up several times. Around 3am I noticed that the tube for the catheter was full of blood. I called the hospital and they told me it was normal. They said they were really busy and they'd call for me to come in between 7 and 8. I didn't get a call so I called again at 830am and they told me to come in.

We arrived at just after 9am. I was in a lot of pain and couldn't sit down. I got registered and sent to the birth unit, where I was put in room 8. I changed to a nightgown and settled in. My nurse had problems putting my IV in but she got it eventually. I was started on low dose oxytocin. My husband and I walked up and down the hall outside my room for a bit, while on the wireless monitors.

I was tired from a lack of sleep so I laid down an rested a while. I watched some Netflix. The contractions were pretty light. My husband went to Subway to get a sandwich. I was getting hungry too, but I didn't want him to suffer with me.

Contractions started picking up around 1230pm-1pm. I walked around the room, groaning a bit when they hit every 3 or 4 minutes. I tried some fetaynol but the relief was short lived. The OB resident did a cervical check but I was still high and posterior. I was nervous that my TOLAC would fail due to that. The check was extremely painful.

I stood by my bed and waited for the epidural. Contractions were getting really strong and close together. I leaned on my husband.

Getting the epidural was rough. It was hard to bend forward and keep my shoulders and back rounded. I almost threw up from the pain. I noticed the numbing in my left foot first, and then the rest of me. I could still move my legs pretty well, they were just numb. It was very relieving.

The next cervical check was really easy. My cervix had dropped and come forward. As soon as the doctor put his fingers in my water broke. I was about 5cm. Everyone was really happy with my progress. My husband later told me that he thought it was in the bag at that point and I would be successful.

I stayed on the bed, on my side. The baby had a few weird dips but nothing that concerned the OB. I felt the odd pain but only one really bad pain. The nurse was concerned because I was having 6 or 7 contractions in a 10 minute period. My right shoulder started to hurt, from lying on it I thought.

The shift change happened and I got a new nurse. She had me switch sides and was fiddling with the monitor. She was having trouble getting my contractions to register properly. I remember thinking that I just wanted a nap while I was waiting to get to 10cm and wished she'd leave me alone.

Then both my shoulders started to hurt. A lot. I tried to twist myself to take pressure off them while keeping my stomach sideways. The nurse kept asking me how my shoulders felt. She ran out of the room and returned with the charge nurse, who wanted me to explain more about my shoulders. I thought everyone was overreacting. It just felt like I had been lying on them too long.

This is where things get hazy. My husband filled me in on a lot of the details later.

My blood pressure started to crash. Four more people, the two OBs and two anesthesiologists came in. They kept asking get me about my shoulder/chest pain. I couldn't answet very well but I do remember thinking everyone was overreacting. My blood pressure tanked. They hooked me up to fluids and put a pressure cuff around the bag and one doctor was squeezing it to get it in my faster. They hit me with ephedrine. They brought in a heart machine to check to see if I were having a heart attack. My husband told me they thought it was a heart attack, an embolism, or a rupture.

The doctors left to discuss me. My husband could hear them through the door. The head anesthesiologist said I needed a section because I was going downhill really fast. He didn't want to have to tell me so the OB resident came in to tell me.

I never hesitated to have a section. I don't really remember what I was thinking about at the time. The OB said I had a choice but I don't really think I did. I was shaking really bad from the ephedrine and it was hard to sign the paper. My husband told me that he thought I was going to die.

They wheeled me down immediately. It was really fast. I laid on the bed thinking that all the movies and TV shows where the person watches the lights on the ceiling as they are wheeled into the OR was spot on. The anesthesiologist checked my throat for intubation if I needed it. He told me I might be knocked out.

They got me set on the table in the OR. I was having trouble breathing. My oxygen saturation rate was low and they gave me a mask. My chest felt heavy. The doctors and nurses seemed very tense.

They put up the curtain. I asked for it to be taken down so I could see but no one was listening to me.

The head OB opened me up and found a fist sized rupture in my uterus at my old scar. My baby's hand was coming through. My stomach was full of amniotic fluid and blood. The pressure from the fluid was causing my shoulders to hurt.

The OB pulled my baby out and he began to cry. He got a 9 on the APGAR test. He was perfectly healthy. Just like with my first, I didn't get to see him right away and my husband didn't get to cut the cord. A nurse took a picture of him so I could see him. It took a bit to get him cleaned up and passed to my husband. They asked if I wanted to hold him but my arms were numb.

My husband told me that he could see quite a lot of blood spray as they sewed me up. I did need a hysterectomy but they said that I could never try for a vaginal birth ever again. They told me that several times, forcefully, even though I said I had wanted my tubes tied if it went to a section previously. They rather made me feel like a stupid idiot who was going to try again in 9 months.

I was put in recovery and left with a nurse. The OB came in to remind me again how I could never have a vaginal birth.

I got to hold my baby a bit later. He started nursing really well. I was sent to my room. I ended up staying an extra day due to the rupture but I healed fairly well.

I'm very disappointed that I failed. All I needed was for my body to hold together for 3 or 4 more hours. I can't give birth and I'll never get another chance to try, even if I wanted to have another baby. This VBAC was supposed to close the door on years of infertility and the trauma of how my first was born and his NICU stay.

Everyone tells me that I should be happy that we are both alive and healthy and that is the most important thing. I feel really bad about feeling bad about how my baby was born. No one seems to understand or care that I feel broken and scarred. I'm in a lot of pain and I don't think I will ever really recover from this experience.",False,
25,A month ago we started seriously potty training our son (2 years 4 months at the time). We did the 3 day method with underwear (not the Oh! Crap! method). Within a few days he was 100% pee trained day and night. But we could not get him to poop on the potty. Pooping in his underwear went on for a month. Soon he started becoming constipated. In the last week he was leaking urine from holding his stool. Then a few days ago something amazing happened. He hid behind the shower curtain while sitting on the potty and pooped. It was then I realized he did not like being watched while he pooped. So we encouraged him hide behind the shower curtain or towel when sitting on the potty and he would happily poop if he couldnt see us.

31,"After almost a year of a few near misses but mostly quiet rejection my wife and I are very close on two different children.

As many of your know most states don’t have “adoption fairs” anymore but they still do in Massachusetts.  We had resisted going for a while because it just felt sort of gross.  But we’d been starting to feel a bit desperate so we decided we’d be willing to try anything.

We had heard there would be as many as 50 kids there which seemed ridiculous.  But then we got there and wow, if you haven’t been it’s quite the experience but, at the same time, somehow felt more natural than the short bios and single headshots we had grown used to picking from online.

We did our best to talk to as many kids as possible but meet two kids we really connected with. One boy and one girl boy of which just turned 9.  Sadly we can adopt them both because we only have a small 2 bedroom apartment so we have to make a choice.

The boy and I really connected at the event, playing catch and just generally running around together.  So much so that he put his arm around me at the end and made me promise to “come to the next one”

The girl was the one we originally went up there to see. She was shy and spent most of her time “hiding” on the swings.  But she played jump rope with us and was really really sweet once we got her out of her shell.

My wife and I agree we had a stronger emotional connection with the boy but that he also has more challenging behaviors including ADHD and a history of disruptive placements.  On top of that he isn’t legally free yet but his worker is confident that he will be after their trial next week, even more so if they can say they have an adoptive family lined up (hint hint)

The girl on the other hand seems more relaxed and much easier to handle day to day. She loves animals which is a huge win for us but had some questions about sexual abuse in her past and is possibly acting out some of that with her older brother (who is being placed elsewhere)

Obviously there’s so much more to say but I’ll spare you all the details. What a wonderful problem for us to have but at the same time how do we feel confident in our choice? Our big fear is the first time parenting gets tough somewhere inside we’ll feel like we made the wrong decision?

I'm a good guy, I am lovable, I am ready for someone in my life after being alone for three years. But am I though..? Am I ready for someone in my life? Am I ready to fall in love again? I have some serious doubts and tons of anxiety already building up.  
We met on an online dating app**\*** (yes, very 2020 of me). She shot me a message, asking me if I want to have a cup of coffee with her. She looks very nice, three years older than me, two kids of her own (17 and 13) and a job as a teacher. Her description of herself showed a lot of common grounds with mine. After setting up the appointment for Wednesday, I intended to leave it there and just see what happens Wednesday; I prefer meeting someone face to face and not through some text messages. But we did keep texting and I found out that she agrees on most issues that I think are important in a relationship. She appears to somewhat personify the image I have of my ideal woman. Is this because I really want to fall in love again? Or is this because she might also be a little desperate to find a partner? And do I focus all of my attention to this one lady who happened to ask me to get a cup of coffee? I mean, what the hell do I know?? My last date was back in the 20th Century!  
She does not sound very desperate but I do notice she is falling for me. Her replies are sweet and very acknowledging towards me. She can't wait for it to be Wednesday. And me too! I really want to see her IRL. But I know myself. Her attention is really boosting my confidence and I tend to lose myself in that. It's really hard to contain my excitement. I feel 18 again! Having said that, I really value the life I have now. It is simple. I can do what I want, when I want. I can focus all of my attention to my kids. I only have to worry about me and my twin boys (9). I can be happy with my very small apartment that is basically a man-cave and thus unsuitable for women, for now... Do I want to change this? Does my need to fall in love again exceed the lifestyle I have now?

37,"Alt account for obvious reasons. 

I started seeing my best friend from high school about eight months ago (we are in our mid 30's now). The relationship with him is going great, but I find myself struggling when it comes to his three children between two other women. 

Now let me start by saying that they are great kids. All three of them. However, it has been a major adjustment for me, someone who has never dated a guy with kids before. I am used to a very free lifestyle. For example, I have always made dinner when I feel like it, vs. now we eat dinner together as a family at a set time, every day. Another example is that I am used to my bedroom being my ""safe space"", somewhere that I can get away and decompress, but now that we have recently started living together and are obviously sharing a room, there are kids constantly in our bedroom and/or knocking on the door every ten minutes. I'm not used to having to watch my mouth or censor the things I watch on Youtube or Facebook. I travel a lot when I can and the places I tend to go aren't anywhere I would feel comfortable taking kids. It's important to note that I don't fault them for this, they're kids, but it still doesn't change the fact that I feel I have nowhere to get a few minutes to myself. I know that comes with the territory, but I guess I am looking for suggestions on how to get adjusted to this new living situation. 

I'm also struggling with trying to determine my ""place"". I guess what I'm trying to say is obviously, I'm not their mother, and I don't ever want to try to take over that role. I'm also not stepmom (and even if/when it comes to that, don't know that I will feel comfortable taking an authority role with kids that I am not the biological parent of. Maybe that will change in time, but at the moment, it scares the shit out of me). One of his ex's, in particular, is extremely toxic and will make my boyfriends life hell given the slightest opportunity, and I feel like I have to constantly walk on eggshells when it comes to their kids because one slip-up (and by that I mean anything she doesn't explicitly agree with me saying/doing; I don't mean anything bad or detrimental to the kids), and she is going to lose her mind and cause him all kinds of stress and/or legal problems - ""I don't want her around my kids"" is the main one that comes to mind). I feel like telling her kids ""no"" or reprimanding them in any way will unleash a hell fury on him and/or myself. He has been great and tried to reassure me that I am within my right to tell them not to do something or say no, but I just don't feel comfortable with it, at least not yet. Up to this point I have been the ""cool girlfriend"" (their words) and I would be lying if I said that part of me isn't worried that saying no to them would make them suddenly dislike me, or more open to listening to the awful things their mother says about me to them.

40,"Am I the only one who just discovered that $50 Plan B is not the only available morning after pill?!?!  Why do I bring this up?  Well cuz I live in the U.S. and every grocery store /pharmacy I have ever lived near only sells Plan B at a premium price. 

It wasn't until I went to Mexico and saw generic levonorgestrel for the equivalent of $10 USD.  I am outraged. Another way for companies to make boucoups of money off of women during a desperate moment. 

I'm not saying this pill should be a go to for contraception, but when a woman needs it, it should not have to cost her the bank. I can't even count how many times in college I didn't purchase Levonorgestrel (aka Plan B) because I couldn't afford it as a struggling student, and lord knows I was not going to ask my parents for the money. Thank goodness I never became pregnant, but I could've been a lot less stressed knowing that I had taken a contraceptive 72hrs or less after having unprotected sex.

  I guess what I'm saying is: this is a form of oppression towards women and I'm PISSED. If the tables were turned and men needed this pill, it would come in millions of different brands, have the side effects tested out, and be available conveniently and a reasonable price.  

It's not just the abortion debate that is against women. It's contraceptives too!  I, as a woman, cannot get the pill, the ring, a shot, an IUD without going to a Dr., paying a copay or paying the whole Dr.'s Bill ( because shocker, I don't have health insurance).  I then have to go back and repeat the expensive process every 6 months in order to keep refilling my Birth Control prescription.  Oh, and on top of the money, I have to be ""checked out"" by the Dr., or in other words:  have a cold metal speculum shoved into my hoo hah in order to be prescribed birth control, even though a pap smear is only necessary every 3 years for a woman in their 20s. Yet another trap to make money off of desperation.

""Buy condoms"", they say! Well guess what I can't trust a man to keep one on, so I must protect myself in other ways. Ladies, there are other options out there besides the premium priced Plan B.  If you read my whole rant, thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

74,"As parents, we are “elders” to our children and expect them to respect us as well.  This is never more important than when we are in public and our children’s behavior is being witnessed by “everyone in the world”.  How your children behave in public reflects directly on you as their parents.  Like it or not, right or wrong, other parents will pass judgment on your parenting skills based upon their observation of your children’s behavior.

Now that we are into our grandchildren years, we can look back and smile at all of those occasions in which we observed children going berserk in grocery and department stores.  You know the 3-5 year old kids I’m talking about.
Little Mary races around the grocery store display until she loses her balance and knocks the display over, soup cans careening across the isle.  The store employee shows up only to have the mother say “Sorry” as if it’s the store’s problem that the food is all over the floor, then turns to chase her child down another isle.
Little Johnny thinks its cute to see how close he can swing his light saber to the dishes on display, only to find that he has grossly misjudged the distance.  Plates and glasses crash to the floor as, off in the distance, the store manager watches with a crest-fallen expression on his face.
Little Susie decides that she doesn’t want to ride in the shopping cart where her mother placed her.  So, she begins screaming at 95 decibels and crying her little eyes out.  People nearby begin to disperse in order to get away from the ear-piercing noise while mother attempt to negotiate with the child to be quiet.  In the end, mother gives way and puts the child on the floor wherein, the child promptly stops crying and begins running up and down the store isles.
Little Bobby takes the soda from his fast food meal and begin to play airplane with the cup.  Unfortunately, he dips the cup one too many times and the lid departs, sending soda all over the restaurant’s new carpet.  Some patrons stare at the scene while others view the restaurant manager’s angry expression and obvious mumbling under his breath.
We have all probably observed this type of early child behavior.  Assuming that the children in these examples were not suffering from a neurological or medical deficit, what would have been your impression of the parents?

When our children were young many years ago, my wife and I often asked each other why these parents would tolerate their children behaving in such an embarrassing manner.  Some would try to quiet their kids but were unsuccessful.  Others carried the facial expression that showed they had resigned the battle before it ever began – their children were “calling the shots” and running the household.

Did we have that problem in our kids?  How did we solve it in less than two months with no recurrences of the behavior?

My kid just turned 3. For the past year, he has said (confidently and consistently) this phrase which my wife and I cannot decipher. I thought I might try here and see if anyone can even identify perhaps a single word, which might be a clue to the rest. Please advise if there is a more ideal sub for this.

Some context:

* He has very good language for his age and has been speaking advanced phrases since around 2.

* He loves Pirates of the Caribbean (Captain Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, etc.), though has not seen the movies, and only knows about it and the characters from the ride at Disneyland (what branding!).

* The phrase, he says, is something Davy Jones says during the part of the ride where he is projected on mist and the riders pass through him, but the audio during that part is very hard to hear. According to the transcript, Davy Jones says the following (it doesn't sound like any of these to me): 

 * ""Hahahaha! Aye, but tales there be aplenty in this cursed place,""
 * ""Ah, but they do tell tales—so says I, Davy Jones,""
 * ""If ye be brave or fool enough to face a pirates’ curse, proceed.""

* The reference to ""stinky toes"" refers to the pirate (on the ride) sitting on a bridge, hanging his feet over - another one of my son's observational obsessions (and something he has imagined Davy Jones gives a warning about, lol).

I suppose it could be gibberish, but like I said, he has good language and can repeat it the same every time - he definitely thinks it means something!

But I'm still a bit sad about it and I still want to talk about it sometimes. Especially when I read/hear stories about labours which result in vaginal deliveries. But I don't feel like I can. It's done, it can't be changed, why dwell on it?

&gt; We see that people in small-scale societies spend more time talking to each other than we do, and they spend no time at all on passive entertainment supplied by outsiders, such as television, video games, and books. We are struck by the precocious development of social skills in their children. These are qualities that most of us admire, and would like to see in our own children, but we discourage development of those qualities by ranking and grading our children and constantly telling them what to do. 

&gt;The adolescent identity crises that plague American teen-agers aren’t an issue for hunter-gatherer children. The Westerners who have lived with hunter-gatherers and other small-scale societies speculate that these admirable qualities develop because of the way in which their children are brought up: namely, with constant security and stimulation, as a result of the long nursing period, sleeping near parents for several years, far more social models available to children through allo-parenting, far more social stimulation through constant physical contact and proximity of caretakers, instant caretaker responses to a child’s crying, and the minimal amount of physical punishment.”

But since we have told him, he gets really upset right before we get to his classroom door and then I have to basically carry him in and leave him crying/hysterical - mentally starting to take a toll on me.

Most of our normal routine is met with resistance now - bath time, bed time, getting dressed time... which is probably totally normal for a 3yo but he was getting to a point where he was being super helpful and not really fighting us on anything. Feels like we went back in time like 3-4 months. He also had his first potty accident at daycare today (been potty trained since a little before turning 3 in November).

It may have nothing to do with the news - not even sure he can 100% even understand but he did tell my in-laws about being a big brother without us around so he must at least somewhat understand. He also just started preschool so that was a big adjustment for him (we both work full time so he's been babysat during the day since he was 6mo).

I guess this is more just venting but feeling really helpless as to how to address his behavior... let it slide knowing he's probably going through a lot of big changes emotionally? try to discipline him as I normally would to not put up such a big fight in the mornings trying to get him ready and drop him off?

I'm 31 and have been married to Mr. Bobcat for just over a year, we've been together 10 years. I had been on the pill for 15 years and stopped Oct 15. Had a short withdrawal bleed right after that. Had some breast soreness and fatigue, and hadn't started AF, but had a negative test just before Thanksgiving. I felt silly taking a test so early so I didn't even mention it to hubby. We've been traveling and visiting with family this month. We went to Disney World with my parents the second week of December, and I had some intense nausea. When I looked online, I found a lot of women saying that they had experienced pregnancy-like symptoms after going off the pill but were not pregnant. I thought for sure this is what was going on with me, and just waited on my period to start. Last week we were out of state at my FIL's and symptoms continued. Mostly no appetite, increased motion sickness, and very sore breasts. We got back yesterday and I decided to grab some tests today to test again. I felt silly again because I haven't even had a period and figured I wasn't ovulating yet. I took a test and got a BFP! Retest said the same thing!

&gt;""Nestle. Fuck Nestle.

I recently graduated with a degree in Public Relations and in one of my case studies classes, we looked at Nestle and how it unethically promoted the use of their baby formula in developing countries. You see, Nestle would offer free samples of baby formula (marketing it as healthier than breast milk) to new mothers in hospitals and maternity wards, which generally seems like a good thing as long as you have no idea how lactation works. Once the mother in this developing country began using this ""free"" formula instead of her own breast milk, her lactation would often cease thereby forcing the mother to maintain her child's diet of formula which was often unaffordable. Also, formula is mixed with water and giving water from developing countries to infants is generally a poor choice.

For more information, this Wiki article backs up my story: [Nestle Boycott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott). If anyone would be more interested in scholarly references, I can provide those as well.

Edit 1: So I didn't realize how huge this would get... I ended up leaving out a whole bunch of information because it was very, very late when I posted this. I was hoping the wiki article would handle things.

Further information on this particular case:

The issue I am referring to occured in the 70s. Many mothers in these developing countries ended up giving thier newborns very, very diluted formula bottles because they simply couldn't afford the cost of the formula that they were effectively unwillingly committed to. This led to many, many infant deaths from malnutrition.

Another important fact to note is that Nestle representatives would often dress as nurses in these Maternity wards to further influence their customers into thinking formula was their best choice.

Many Redditors are commenting on the issue of HIV infected breastmilk vs. formula. This issue is easily covered by this statement: In the case of HIV+ mothers, if the water is clean in your region and you can afford formula, use formula; if the water is contaminated in your region, breastfeed.

For those questioning the current practices of Nestle compared to this seemingly one-time incident, Nestle has been an unethical company for decades. The most recent issue that has surfaced with Nestle is their current power grab for water. This was recently outlined in a Reddit post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16b30x/nestle_ceo_thinks_water_should_be_privatized_and/).

For those who want references:

[This](http://www.amazon.com/Public-Relations-Practices-Managerial-Problems/dp/0132341360) is the book we used in class. It outlines the issue very well and as unbiased as can be. Otherwise, here's some MLA citation of journal articles for you:

Baker, James C. ""The international infant formula controversy: a dilemma in corporate social responsibility."" Journal of Business Ethics 4.3 (1985): 181-190.

George, Susan. ""Nestle Alimentana SA: the limits to public relations."" Economic and Political Weekly (1978): 1591-1602.

Gilly, Mary C., and John L. Graham. ""A macroeconomic study of the effects of promotion on the consumption of infant formula in developing countries."" Journal of Macromarketing 8.1 (1988): 21-31.

Edit 2: I knew I forgot something!

Some Redditors are being discouraged by just how many brands Nestle owns so here's a list of all of Nestle's products: Nestle Products. If you do intend to boycott Nestle, you're actually going to have to give up a lot of foods. But! On the plus side, most of them are highly processed and generally unhealthy for you anyway, so you'll also be healthier!

Final Edit

Thanks to all for the feedback! I've attempted to respond to the majority of your questions and I will continue to field any and all questions as best as I can. I only hope that you have found this conversation to be constructive. I would just like to leave you all with one comment (which may seem lofty, but you rarely get a chance like this).

Every dollar you spend is a vote. Remember that. Every time you support a company that ignores basic human rights, you are actively voting against the interests of humanity. I know it's difficult and frustrating to take these issues into consideration before purchasing products, but please, do your best. Every person is responsible for their own actions and if you're not helping humanity, you're hindering it.

Thanks, Reddit. Stay classy.""

As I have said above, I have done some further research to be certain that this is not hyperbole, that it is not an opinion, or a pissed off former employee. I am sorry to say that I cannot find anything to refute what this posts describes. Nestle has lost my family's business forever. I hope you do your own research and follow your heart.

I'm becoming increasingly concerned regarding the amount of days my son is missing school. He started reception in September, and so far has an attendance of only 76%.  


He has a chronic medical condition (""very early onset"" Crohn's disease) that causes, amongst other things, abdominal pain, lethargy and joint pain, and his diet partially consists of liquid food as a result. The condition is very much under control at the moment and the medical team responsible for him are very happy with how he's doing.  


The problem comes with the differences in opinion between my spouse and myself regarding how bad his absence record is. Personally, I feel he is missing too many days; my spouse will not send him to school when he has the most minor of niggles, and I now think he's beginning to ""ham up"" his symptoms. For example, he missed school earlier this week because he work up complaining of ""an achey ankle"", which my spouse will link to our son's condition ""flaring"". He tried the same with me yesterday (my spouse and I work opposing shifts), but was still managing to run and jump about, so I sent him in, from which he came back happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat down and worked out what the attendance is when I'm at home versus when my spouse is at home. (We both work ""part time"" around each other's shift rotas (which includes nights), spouse does 24 hours a week, I do 38 hours a week averged - yes, that's part time for me!). When spouse is home alone, his attendance is 73% (36 days out of 49), when I'm at home alone, it's 100%. (15 days out of 15) If you count the days when we're both home in the figures, our son goes 74% of the day when my spouse is in the house (51 days out of 69), and 86% of the time when I'm in the house (30 days out of 35).  


The other debate is that my spouse uses our son's brightness to say it's OK that he misses it (He's way way ahead of his peers at school in all areas of the curriculum) as ""he's not going to be learning anything he doesn't already know yet"".

&amp;#x200B;

112,"Cayden was born @ 34 weeks and spent 2.5 weeks in the hospital (he is actual age 9 months and gestational almost 8 months). I know that isnt very long but I am still dealing with it. for one the medical bill we are still paying off is a monthly reminder. But during his stay I tried nursing which led to pumping only which eventually led to a complete mental breakdown on my part and now he is formula fed which is something I still struggle with. the phrase ""breast is best"" on the formula can doesnt help any. 

So then he came home and was doing okay but he had undescended testicles which resulted in a 3 hour long surgery and more stress for me also more medical bills. He is also not reaching developmental milestones and was evaluated. He passed but barely.Well at his 9 month appt we were told he needs to go to an eye doctor because he has inward turning eyes. Okay now that isn't a big deal we kind of expected that. We didn't expect that he needs to go see a neurologist. He doesn't sit up, crawl, stand, hold his own bottle, talk/babble, recognize his name even a little, and so on ; his doctor is very concerned and wants him evaluated. I am terrified. At birth the cord was wrapped around his neck twice and he wasn't breathing right away; I often wonder if this is the cause of most of this. There is just so much going on. I never really had PPD or at least I don't think I did. I found the questionnaires at the the dr's office a little vague and they didn't really apply to me and what I was going thru. I never really had anyone ask me ""How I was doing"" it was just all about Cayden and I get it but I think I am struggling. Even in the hospital nobody asked How I was doing with the fact I had to leave my baby. I carried him for 7.5 months and I had to just leave him. 

I struggle to talk to my friends because they are all saying ""well my baby didn't sit up till 7 mths old"" or "" he didn't crawl till 8 mths old"" its like thats great but its not just those things it's all of it. They thinks his doctor is paranoid and I should just wait and let him be. Well you can't really do that or at least we don't want to do that. But I just don't have any support or anyone to listen to me. My mom just starts to cry and my husband doesn't quite understand what I'm going through.

Issue:  We have a 7 month old and my wife wants to start trying for another baby.  From my point of view we are in no position to do so.

Explanation.  I am in an embarrassing situation.  I'm 34 years old and making a career change. I do not currently have a job.  I don't have much money.  I am receiving money from my dad.  And last but not least, we cannot even afford a place of our own right now - we are living with my parents.  

I believe our decision to have our current child was more out of bio clock fear than any practical consideration.  We didn't even evaluate our finances before we started trying.  Now we have a son and I love him so much, but things are really challenging for us - financially and mentally.  

My viewpoint is that we really just made our son ""happen"" without regard to our situation.  We aren't in the best situation for even THIS child as it is.  

My wife wants to have another baby now.  Her logic is that we are already being helped by my parents - what's another baby.   I told her that our situation is very precarious as it is and that I think things will be much more stable in a couple years.

This isn't to see who is right.  Neither of us are right.  It isn't about that.  I'm looking for perspective opinions.  What about this issue am I missing?  What is she missing?  What do others feel about our situation.

133,"Each year young Americans begin ‘experimenting’ with drugs.  These are not actually experiments.  They can more rightfully be termed first time use.  For the purpose of the few lines I am going to write here what will be described are not the illicit first time uses of drugs but the introduction to some of the most powerful mood altering, mind impacting and physically integrated drugs of all – the opioids.

Young athletes can sometimes play hard.  Even if they don’t a small mistake or accident can lead one of them to the Emergency Room for a sprained ankle, pulled muscle, bruise or to get checked out for a possible fracture.  Things are slowly changing, with the emphasis on slowly, and understanding that change is not happening in many parts of the country, but what often happens for these young, impressionable people is that they are prescribed powerful opioids.

Emergency Rooms, except in Washington State, have long reached for the opioids as a panacea when presented with minor pain.  A prescription of oxycodone or oxycontin of 30 to 60 to 90 pills were often provided.  Considering that the human body can develop a dependence upon opioids in a few as three days (just a few doses) you can see why many of those who are prescribed these pills can easily have their bodies and minds become addicted.

This has been happening, as has been noted in the papers, because large pharmaceutical companies introduced the Smiley Face, or Pain Chart, as the ‘Fifth Vital Sign’.  The four vital signs are Body Temperature, Pulse Rate, Respiration Rate, Blood Pressure.  The Pain Chart, developed by drug companies and provided to doctors, is introduced at one of the most intimate and important parts of the doctor/patient interview.  It is being used as the basis for what the doctor does next.  Out of the many faces on the chart there is only one Smiley Face.  The rest offer some degree of pain and for each one the response to the pain these days are pills.

In the past young athletes would have been provided aspirin or some other minor analgesic which did not contain any opioids.  They would have been cautioned to alternately rest or move the injured appendage and instructed to either ice or heat the area, depending on the injury.  No mind altering, body changing drugs involved.

These days millions of doctors across the nation prescribe opioids young athletes and do not directly address the injury.  What can happen next is a series of missteps that could affect the young person’s entire life and may actually end in severe disability or death.

Opioids are a very powerful form of drug.  They are suitable for end of life pain, cancer pain and severe wounds.  At this time there are super-powerful forms of the drugs which have been developed to be used on soldiers in combat and others to tranquilize large animals like a 2,400 pound bull or a 13,000 pound elephant.  These drugs, by the way, are available in  hospitals across the nation and are being sold on the street illicitly.  These drugs cross the boundary between the honest medical system and illegal trade on the street.

As mentioned these young athletes can find themselves dependent upon the drugs very quickly.  Some of them will become addicted, also, in a very short period of time.  All of them – if they have taken the pills somewhat regularly - when they cease taking the pills will feel ill.  They will feel sick.  They will identify the drug as easing the sickness.  When they run out of the prescription many of them will seek, or be offered by others, access to the drug they were taking.

It is a simple step for them to discover that the same effect is provided by heroin at a much lower price.

That’s right.  These days heroin is priced lower than these pharmaceutical drugs.  The pharmaceutical drugs are preferred by most of the people who take them but price moves many to the illicit drug trade.  So we easily arrive at an addict who is using great quantities of heroin or other opioids during a relatively short period of time – just two to three years.  These years usually correspond to high school years or spill into college and early work careers.  The results are catastrophic.

Opoids are known as a pharmakon.  They are both a medicine and a poison.  Taking them incorrectly for the wrong reason can lead to bad consequences including disability and death.  Even when taking them legally and having been prescribed to them can lead to unintended consequences.  They can and do cause early death.

Please be careful and be aware of what is being prescribed to your children.  It is a matter of life and death.",False,

136,"Education is shouldn’t just be a priority but a birth right for any child growing up in the 21st century. To keep up with changing times, individuals should be well equipped and capable of critically make sense of a world in line with developing a holistic view of their own. Education has become more accessible to people around the world, with newer curriculum and newer courses available. Rural areas in many lesser economically developed countries (LEDC’s) still have to embrace the importance of education. In countries like the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Colombia, education in rural areas are scarce opportunities for children growing in conditions that are otherwise really tiring. It is crucial that nurturing the future is done the right way and basic education is the most important piece of this puzzle. Education can shape the future of any given area if the resources and energy are dedicated to the cause in the right way, channeling it to the youth of the vicinity. By the time a child grows into adulthood, the world should be a place of opportunity where they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skill sets to pursue their ambitions.  Whether you grew up in a family of farmers or doctors, education plays a vital role in sustenance of livelihoods today. Although governments are primarily entitled with the responsibility of spreading awareness about education to rural areas, communities, religious institutions and societies play a vital role. Conducting seminars and workshops are a task that could impact a small populace, although physically establishing learning centers and implementing programs to filter through the talent pool of a youth in the rural area could prove more efficient. Granting equal access is important and so is enriching the elders with the importance of education for their children. Something as simple as a creative television or radio advertisement talking stressing on the importance of education in today’s world could prove effective. Engaging students of well-educated areas with children deprived of education in rural areas can rub off some essential skills and practices within a community that gives more weight to the right kind of education.

Just seeing your son or daughter fly around in a superhero cape is a beautiful sight. Faith in superheroes teaches children more than just admiring people; it also instills a sense of togetherness towards greater good. Such are many other toys that have influences on childhood, developing creativity, perspective, problem solving and promoting learning.
Many toys designed have had a great effect on growing children, equipping them with skills that go along with their play time. What better way to learn than through fun. Before an age where sports begin to dictate growth among peers, fun games and toys can aid in the development of many life skills at a young age.
A few examples of toys and games that enrich learning, problem solving and develop creativity as well as social skills in younger children are listed here:
•    Korner’d
•    Yoga Spinner
•    Jenga
•    Tangle Therapy
•    WePlay Ruock N Fish
•    uKloo Early Reader Treasure Hunt Game

142,"Ex and I are both going on separate trips this weekend.  My daughter lives with my ex in a city two hours away from where I work during the week.  I get to have my daughter every other weekend since I am working and staying out of town.  

  I call to FT everyday after work for a few minutes and as they are in bed for bedtime.  My daughter is 2 years 3 months now.  My ex usually leaves the phone on the ground or propped up so I can see her but as with any toddler the attention span is not long.  She calls me or I call her during bedtime and I can already tell she is annoyed.  

 This weekend I had made plans to go out of town for my birthday.  It fell on my weekend, but I asked to switch a couple of months back.  I didn't know at the time my Ex was also making plans to be out this weekend as well.  Today she tells me she is leaving at noon tomorrow and coming back late Sunday night.  Our daughter is staying with her Grandma and Grandpa who they live with.  

  I have asked if I could FT Grandma before to see my daughter for a minute, but my Ex has gone off on me saying that I am being inconvenient to them as they are already doing us a favor.  That when she is not around it is more difficult since Grandma is not obligated to FT with me.  I asked about this weekend, since there would be 4 days almost without seeing my daughter.  My ex again told me she would FT me on Monday when she is back in town.  

 I cant help but get so mad that I can't ask Grandma if she has a minute for me to FT to see my daughter.  Its not for a long time, I understand my daughter is at an age where it is more difficult to stay still but I am just requesting to ask if they are available.  My Ex and I just got into a heated argument where she is telling me I am being selfish and just thinking about what I want, not about others.  She told me my daughter hardly ever wants to FT so she doesn't force it.  I feel like she just doesn't want to deal with giving me the time.  I feel she is punishing me for going on this trip I planned a while ago and that her parents are doing us the favor so I shouldn't bother to FT them.  However, she can probably call all she wants??

  What irritates me the most is when I have my daughter, I have to pick up every call or she flips out.  I make the effort to hold the phone the whole call so she can see our daughter better.  I do things I would expect in return, however, I don't get the same in return.  

 I just need to let out this rant.  We get so heated with each other she starts to curse as my daughter lays by her trying to sleep.  I tell her to watch her language and she accuses me of changing the subject and to get to my point.  

  I don't know how to go about this situation.  If I don't make the effort to try and call everyday, then I see her only 4 days a month, 64 hours a month! I just want to make sure my daughter knows me, that I am here for her and love her very much.",True,

So there's a major Asian holiday coming up, and my MIL has made a dinner reservation for tomorrow without consulting us first (as usual), even despite the fact that this year, we come with a 8-week-old in tow. There's a flu bug going around right now in our area, and the restaurant is fully booked and therefore definitely going to be crowded, and it's the kind of occasion where people are going to be out whether they're ill or well. 

Add to that the fact that she made the reservation for 7pm. LO is a terrible napper, which means that by the time 6pm rolls around every day, she is extremely cranky and overtired and just needs to go to bed hence we usually start her bedtime routine at 7, and even then, it's still another 2-4 hours of pacifying before we can get her fully asleep (because Lord, does this girl fight sleep however tired she is). 

Am i just being completely paranoid and overprotective in Not wanting to attend said dinner? Husband isn't being too supportive and going on about how his family will definitely be talking shit if we don't attend and lecture him about how 'it's just once a year' and it's TRADITIONNNN. well, honestly, screw tradition when I have a vulnerable newborn, no? besides, we weren't even ASKED before these plans were Dictated. 

So, go or no go? or am i just overthinking this? HELP. 

(on another note, we also tried clipping LO's nails for the first time today and the husband took a chunk of skin off her finger and it bled for pretty long and looks -to me, at least- like a really deep cut. bleeding has since stopped and she seems fine, but i am still freaked out, please tell me it's normal and that she's going to be okay and i don't need to run to the doctor because i am so tempted to but of course the husband says i'm overreacting. is there such a thing as mom paranoia?)",True,

I would say the 2 key things are consistency and encouragement. 

It took him \~2 weeks to get the groove of things with the oh crap method. The first week (7 days) was hell. It was inconsistent and had ups and downs, I considered giving up. During 2nd week, everything become more consistent and flat. Therefore, my advice would be to not give up unless you see no improvements after 7 days. 

Currently, he has no diaper during naps and doing fine, but we still use diapers overnight. His signal is scratching his pee pee (took us almost 2 weeks to get a tell). His accidents occur when 1. he's having way too much fun and being distracted and doesn't want to pee 2. he needs to but cannot poop, like if he goes over a full day without pooping he'll pee a lot the next day 3. he drinks/chugs an abnormal amount of water 4. we ask him to hold it in for too long 5. he's overtired.

149,"First of all, I would like to say a massive thank you to each and every one of you on this subreddit. I've been so low this past week or so and you've helped me massively.



As a brief, I was diagnosed with PCOS recently, I'm only 21 so it's a massive blow. I haven't ovulated now in 3 months. I haven't had an AF in that time either. I'm not going to count this past 3 months as trying, but in total we've been 'trying' for 8 months if you count this 3 month cycle.




Recently about three family members on both sides of mine and my partners families have announced they're pregnant. One of them being my cousin and the other being his sister (The third is a pretty distant relative)




Both babies are due in May of next year and I'm heartbroken over it. I feel so selfish but not  a single part of my body is happy for them. It makes me even angrier that my boyfriends sister didn't particularly want a baby - she's 35 and claimed the baby was an accident as they 'weren't really actively trying'  HOW is a 35 year old woman falling pregnant accidentally and I'm here struggling?





I used to get advertisements on Facebook for clear blue and other pregnancy related posts and I've had to hide each and every one of them as I can't stand seeing it anymore. 




I've also developed an aversion to young children and babies. My partner has a 6 month old nephew and I cannot stand being around him. I have nothing against the baby, I LOVE babies but I can't stand seeing my partner being a brilliant uncle to him and knowing he won't be doing that with our own baby any time soon. Luckily, my partner respects me massively and I'm never pushed to see the baby.




I have a little sister who has just turned 4 who I raised from being a tiny baby and she's the only little one that I can tolerate, but saying that, I can't even look at her baby pictures without sobbing. She is basically my adoptive daughter and I do find some comfort in that. We have the same mom and dad but my dad is always working and my mom suffers from a pretty severe disability that she was hit with just after my sister was born. I've found myself looking DEEPLY into genetics just to bring myself some comfort. I will sit for hours and say to myself 'I share the same amount of DNA with my sister as I would my own child so that's ok.' and 'I will share the same amount of DNA with my sisters eventual children as I would my own grandchildren so that's ok I guess' - I'm going crazy, ladies. She started school in September and I cried for an entire week as my baby was growing up.




I'm so glad I have this subreddit where I'm protected from hearing about babies and pregnancy announcements, nobody but people who are struggling to conceive realise how much that means.



I'm sick of being so bitter and unhappy, I've no idea where to turn really. I guess I just need some advice and insight as some days I feel really alone.

Me: low supply after bad latching, two bouts of mastitis and associated c diff infection.  LO is now three months. Latch finally corrected and have been waging a supply building campaign with nursing every two hours followed by pumping during the day, fenugreek, and trying to take it easy.
Barriers to success: she sleeps through the night.  I know, I know, run me out of here on a rail.  But, I wake up and pump at least once a night. Also, I'm back to work in two weeks and won't be able to pump so often.

I went to one on Friday. It was my first time being adjusted pregnant. I have been adjusted in the past but he was a total quack that caused me to be bed ridden for 3 days. So I've been a little skeptical when it comes to chiropractic work. However, I was desperate for relief after severely aggravating my SPD issue Wednesday morning. I could barely walk it was so bad. 

I found my chiropractor online on a list of natural birth providers. I went ahead and scheduled an appointment the next day. 

I told him about my SPD pain and lower back stiffness when I get up from laying down or sitting too long. I also told him I was concerned about my LOs position. He's head down but sideways. I'm worried about him turning posterior. 

He started the adjustment by putting my pubic disc back in place. Umm holy hell did that hurt! 

Then he started working on my abdominal ligaments to release tension and hopefully allow him room to turn into the correct position. That didn't feel great either honestly. 

Then he adjusted my hips and lower back. No pain, totally fine.

I swear to you, I got off that table feeling like I was not at all pregnant. No more SPD pain, no lower back stiffness. I'm still in awe. Today my pubic bone is sore from his adjustment but I don't feel the weakness or pain I was feeling. I can walk normally. My lower back didnt seize up or bother me any of the 4 times I woke up to pee in the middle of the night. 

My abdominal ligaments have been a bit sore. Nothing bad though. I will say that whatever he did, put my guys head right on my bladder! The whole pregnancy I haven't had trouble with frequent urination or my guy hitting my bladder. I went from getting up 1x a night before the adjustment to 4x a night.

192,"Hello all,

I've been pretty quiet here for most of this pregnancy but as I approach the end I am getting really scared. My doctor is telling me that even though Twin A is head down I HAVE to have a scheduled c section if Twin B does not turn from breech by August 14. The surgery has already been booked since last week. I am feeling pretty sick over it. My doctor is not comfortable with doing a breech extraction, which I understand, but she has not even brought up the possibility that Twin B might flip after Twin A is born or that she could maybe do an ECV after Twin A is out of the way. I am required to have an epidural and be in the OR for a twin birth anyway. I would be willing to risk a double whammy for the chance of delivering both vaginally.

I've have three successful vaginal births, the twins each have their own sack &amp; placenta, and I don't really want to deal with a prolonged painful recovery if there are other options. I don't want to have to be on antibiotics that might give me and the babies a yeast overgrowth while I try to breastfeed and care for two newborns. I don't want metal staples in my belly (doctor said I HAVE to have staples, sutures are not an option). I really, really don't want to have to take strong painkillers. I used to have a problem with them when I was younger and have a very high tolerance to them so I am afraid that the prescribed dosage will not even work to control the pain of a c section. I don't really trust this doctor as much as I should but this late in my pregnancy switching is not an option. None of the other doctors in town will even give me a second opinion because they need to be able to bill Medicaid for a certain length of time.

Not sure what to do other than continue doing spinning babies exercises and get used to the idea of a c section. I am really frustrated that I hear and read about other women having options that I am not being offered. Last night I was in triage because I hadn't felt one of the babies move all day, and as I was leaving the nurse asked if I was having a natural birth or a c section. I told her what was going on with Twin B being breech and she mentioned that they'd just delivered a set of twins where Twin B had flipped 15 minutes after A was born. So it isn't even the hospital rules saying this is how it has to be.

I will try to ask at my next appointment about delivering Twin A vaginally and seeing what happens, but I feel like this doctor has already decided how it is going to be and I have no say so whatsoever.",True,discipline
193,"Hello all.  I'm a new dad of a son with DS.  We knew ahead of his birth that he had DS.  We had genetic testing done, it came back with a high chance, and then we did the amnio and found out for sure.  As I'm sure was the case with many of you, there were tears, questions, and lots of wondering what we were going to do.  Every option was on the table, and we quickly realized that abortion was out of the question.  For the next few months we looked at the possibility of adoption, but finally decided that we were going to keep him.

He was born on the 13th, and we were very lucky with a few things.  The ultrasounds had shown a heart problem, with a hole between the ventricles.  After he was born, the echo showed that the hole was much smaller than expected, and will heal itself (most likely) within the first 6 months of his life.  

He did have a web across his small intestine, which required surgery within the first 12 hours of his life.  He came through the surgery with no problems, and even forced them to take him off the ventilator within 8 hours of the surgery because he wanted to breathe on his own and was fighting against it!

I'm here because....well....I guess I just am looking for a community of those who know what I'm looking at, and will accept the questions that I have, the tears that I know are coming, and can celebrate the wonderful things that will come as well.  We have a great support system, and he has a wonderful godfather and godmother as well, who have been great friends of ours for a number of years and almost broke down crying when they were asked to be his godparents.

194,"Hello everyone!

I have a 15 month old (and another on the way - due in December!). We've been using cloth diapers since she was 1 week old and overall, we have had a great experience and plan to continue with baby #2.

We use Thirsties hemp prefolds and Flip one size fits all covers.

My diapers are kind of starting to smell though. I've never stripped them (I'm too intimidated) but I'm thinking this month before #2 arrives might be a good time. 

My current wash routine is:
1) put diapers and covers in top loading washer on hot. I use a little scoop of baby oxy and Biokleen laundry detergent.
2) after regular wash cycle is done, I remove the covers and put them in the dryer for about 10-20 minutes.
3) I start another regular, hot water cycle in the washer and this time I add about 1/4-1/2 cup vinegar and a generous scoop of baking soda.
4) I let it agitate for a few minutes then let them sit for a long time. Like at least an hour.
5) I finally close the washer and let it finish the regular cycle.
6) I dry the prefolds on high for as long as it takes to dry them completely. 

I've read on the Thirsties website that I should use some Dawn dish soap, and I'm ready to go ahead and try that, I was just curious if anyone else has some experience with Thirsties and stripping them for the ammonia odor.

198,"Hello everyone. I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me concerning my daughter. She has mild autism and ADHD. She functions at a high level and does well in social interactions. She only has meltdowns when she is very upset, which is rare. However, for the past couple weeks, she's been randomly soiling herself and I have absolutely no idea why.

The first time it happened, we were in the car coming home from the grocery store. I heard her pass gas, but I smelled that she had an accident. She did not say that she had to use bathroom earlier. I asked her if she had an upset stomach or if anything else was wrong, but she just totally shutdown. She stayed totally silent and sat still while looking down at her feet. When we got home, she was hesitant cleaning up by herself. It was a very messy accident and she was getting overwhelmed, so I just got her cleaned up and dressed myself. Afterwards, she was back to her regular self. I figured it was just a one time accident and didn't think anything of it. 

Three days later, she had an accident just before bedtime. She needed me to clean her up that time as well. The next day she did it at school. She refused to clean herself and didn't want the nurse or anyone else to do it either. She only wanted me and even had a meltdown until I arrived. School was half over and and she obviously was having a bad day, so I just took her home early. She soiled herself again the next morning right as we were leaving to to take her to school. I got her cleaned up and took her to school anyways. She wasn't upset and loves school, so it's not like she was trying not to go.

That's when I decided to put her back in diapers until we get this figured out. I'm glad I did because the accidents became more frequent. Yesterday she made absolutely no attempt at using the bathroom, but today she used the bathroom normally. Whenever she has an accident, she wants me to clean her every time and flat out refuses to do it on her own. 

I just don't know where this came from. She has been fully potty trained since she was 4 years old. I honestly can't remember the last time she wet her pants. The only poop accidents she's had in the past were just from her having diarrhea and just not being able to get to the bathroom in time. She's never done it deliberately like does now.

I wanted to take some time to give a general update on the subreddit and the direction we're going in from now on.

Both myself and /u/sarabara82 were offered to become mods of this subreddit in the summer of 2015. We graciously accepted and have done what we can since then to help keep this subreddit running smoothly while offering advice and help when needed.

Part of the cleanup of the subreddit includes revamping the sidebar, finally writing the wiki, setting up automoderator, and clearing out the old spam filter.

Let's break it down:

1) Man that spam filter. Let me tell you. Whew. There was 10 pages of junk. And actually, lots of legitimate member posts! I am so sorry your posts got caught! I messaged a number of you to let you know your post basically got eaten and to repost if you would want to. Make sure to look at the subreddit and let us know if you think your post got stuck in the spam filter. We'll look into it right away.

2) Automoderator- I'm working on figuring out the gibberish that is the automod setup wiki. First and foremost I'm going to set it up to filter out what is clearly spam. Accounts set up 5 minutes ago will get caught. If you have a new account or set one up for the sole purpose of posting here, let us know. We respect if you set up a throwaway or separate account for privacy or any other reason.

3) The wiki. If you look at it right now (go [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/clothdiaps/wiki/index), don't laugh too hard. Please? It looks like I'm yelling by the bottom. I'm working on figuring out reddit's strange way of formatting stuff. I wish it was as easy as a word processor! I welcome your input on what the wiki should include.

4) SIDEBAR. I need your help. I want to know what quick links you'd want to see as a new visitor to the subreddit or if you're a frequent flyer looking for a quick link to something. I was thinking of a few things but wanna know what you'd want to see.


Now that you've made it this far, I think it's time to reward you.

Did you hear that? Did someone say SPRING GIFT EXCHANGE?!?!?!

Didn't hear it? Oh that was the voice in my head! Durnit!

Okay, so I'm done making myself chuckle. I know I'm not nearly as funny as I wish I was.

So I need get a vote. I have 2 ideas for our next big exchange. I need to know what you wonderful people think.

I'm thinking A) accessories- rash cream, snappis, pins, wet bags, kam snaps, leggings, wipe solution, etc. --OOOOOORRRR-- B)something else. Traditional diapers? Something different?

I'm leaving voting open on this topic until the last day of January, or if answers peter out before then. I'm setting the comments on this thread to ""contest mode"". Please upvote comments you agree with on the upcoming exchange and add in your suggestions.

We fully acknowledge that we did this ourselves - my mom lives with us and we occasionally talked about making him eat by himself but never really enforced it. Now during meal times, he refuses to use a spoon or a fork to eat the actual meal, and either pushes his entire plate off of his tray or throws a huge fit. If we don't help him eat, he just won't eat. Or he will sit there and cry and ask for dinner but refuse to eat it by himself.

I know he physically has the dexterity to eat - he can use a fork to eat fruit and use a spoon to eat cereal or apple sauce - but seems only willing to eat by himself for these things and never the actual main course. He also has no problems picking up food like toast and other bite sized items with his hands obviously.

This battle is exhausting, it is ruining dinner time for everyone! Any tips from reddit parents? Would great appreciate any advice.

206,"Hello parents out there. I'm not a parent myself, but I am the son of a 73 year old single mother, whom I love dearly. But today, things went sour.

I used to have severe ADHD back when I was in elementary school. My mother had to fight the school district I was in relentlessly so that I would be able to go to school without needing medication or extreme segregation from the other students. We cared about each other. I still love her. But in about the 7th grade, everything started going downhill.

In middle school, I was finally rid of my IEP and subsequently my aide. My grades immediately began to slip, and by 9th grade, I didn't really care about school anymore. My mother, having been a teacher for over 30 years, was obviously very distraught. She began to make an effort to tell me every day how horrible of a person I was, and how much of a failure I would be. Obviously this started fights between us. I love her and would never lay a finger on her, the most I've done is hit or slam doors to try to shock her out of the fight. But because she needs to be right all the time, it never works and seems to be a catalyst for the fights to continue. Last year, in 10th grade, the mental abuse got so bad that she told me I should just kill myself multiple times. Thankfully I have a very outgoing and happy attitude and I'm not depressed, but words still sting.

Through the past year, all of my friends and most of their parents have become aware of my situation. One of my friends has threatened to call CPS and let me live with him. I have adamantly refused because I love my mother and I don't think she deserves to live out her final days with nobody at her side. Some friends have suggested that I have Stockholm Syndrome.

Today, just about half an hour ago, things went really bad. I've finally made an effort to keep my grades up now that I'm in junior year, am holding all A's and have scored above 34 on all of my ACT's. but she still insists on calling me a failure. I finally snapped today and pushed her onto the couch. While it wasn't hard at all, she was frightened by the 6 foot, 200 pound wrestler who pushed her. She wants me to leave and go live with someone else, but I don't want to hurt her.

My friend (we'll call her Jill) is a nanny to a 5 month old, and is currently watching the child for 10 hours per day. The mom leaves 3-5 oz of breastmilk for her per day and does not supplement.

Jill has told the mother that the baby seems hungry but the mom just brushes it off and says that her breasts will produce as much as the baby needs to eat. Jill tapped into some of the frozen stores and was scolded by the mother and told those were only for emergencies....

Some other pertinent info-- the mom feeds the baby twice in the morning before leaving for work. We are not sure about the evening.

I have a 6 month old and this seems nuts to me... my daughter has been eating at minimum 20 oz per day while I am at work for like 2 months now.

That being said... I know each baby is different. I think this sounds nuts and dangerous for the baby, but maybe I'm wrong?

What are your thoughts parents? What should Jill do?

Edit: Thank you guys for your help. Glad to know that I am not off base on thinking that this issue is urgent and alarming. Today the mother left 3.5 oz and the baby has been crying all day.

Edit 2 update: Jill pushed back at the mom and managed to get the mom to let her use some formula. She said the baby calmed down immediately after a almost 4 oz bottle and took a 3 hour nap, likely from exhaustion. She got on the mom's case and the mom said she'd get some gripe water... Ugh. The plan is to ask the mom in the morning again what To do if she runs out of food. She is then going to sit down with the mom that night and speak to her experience and concerns. I told her to be sure to say tht she is in full support of EBF but she's not sure how to handle when the baby seems to want more food.

220,"Hello,

I gave birth a week ago and tried to breastfeed and pump. It was OVERWHELMING for me as a FTM and my husband and I decided formula would be fine for our family. 

Our pediatrician told us for my girl’s first few months, we need to use premixed. Is this always true? He hinted that powder would be okay but he wasn’t “really” supposed to say this.

Also, what are the cheapest stores to buy he premixed? I found some on closeout this week but they are typically rather pricey.

221,"Hello,

I'm a 38 year old single father.  I have two children.  One of them, my youngest who is a toddler, is in the autism spectrum.  Right now I'm working two jobs, one full time and one part time which are grossing a tiny bit above $30K per year.

I have a bachelors degree but it's pretty well unusable in the area I live.  I can possibly find work with it in other states but in reality I'd have a better chance if I had a masters degree.  Either way, I'm probably going to have to move to another state if I want to get back into my field of interest.

To be honest, I'm scared to do this.  Primarily because I won't be able to see my kids very often.  I'm afraid that my youngest especially will no longer want anything to do with me as he already doesn't seem to like spending time with me.  

I'd like to hear from those of you who made the leap to another state for better employment or furthering your education.  

How did/does the distance from and limited time with your child(ren), especially if they are autistic or disabled, impact your relationship with him/her/them?  

Do you feel that making the move was the best decision?  

Any insight into this will be appreciated.

Thank's in advance.",True,
222,"Hello,

My brother had his second child in 2012, and the boy was born with Down Syndrome. He had a host of other ailments/complications during childbirth but it seems as though he's made it through the worst of them.

My question is; what are some ways in which I can support my brother, my nephew, and the rest of their family? I have only seen my new nephew once in person (they live in Wales, I'm in WA state) so it's hard to form a consistent relationship with the child.

I see them post various DS related articles, charities, and stories to their social networks, but I'm not sure if it's my place to do the same. I don't want them to think I'm jumping on some sort of bandwagon or being disingenuous with my posts seeing as I don't usually post anything similar. I also haven't done nearly enough reading on the condition to fully understand what to expect.

Basically, I'm looking for someone to point me in the right direction to start learning more about Down Syndrome and how I can be supportive and involved in my new nephews life, even if it's from 5000 miles away.

For the record, they seem very happy despite the hardships they've faced thus far, and my older (7-8yr old) nephew vehemently loves his little brother. The little one seems so much more full of life and vigour now compared to his first 6-10 months, and I'll be damned if he isn't the cutest baby I've ever seen. I don't even like kids that much so maybe it's a biological trait to be predisposed to love your own kin, but seriously; this baby is adorable.

I just want to feel like I'm doing more for my brother, be it in spoken support or some form of activism.

I just found this sub so I apologise if I'm breaking any etiquette with this post.

226,"Hello, I think this is my first time posting here. 
Today, I just want to vent. 
So I have two delightful boys, ages 6 and 2.5, a husband who spends roughly 25 days at his job and the rest home (though it is getting better) a cat, a dog, some fish and a salamander.
I have been doing this stay at home parenting thing for 6 years and I still absolutely hate it. 
I hate cleaning everything up CONSTANTLY, I hate the endless laundry, I hate doing dishes. I have tried getting my kids to help and nothing. They get distracted and wind up doing nothing while I'm trying to get things done. I do discipline them and it works for a bit but then nothing. But thats another story.
I hate that I have ZERO time to myself, and that my hopes and dreams and ambitions have to be set aside so that I can help my family and raise our kids to be decent, productive members of society. And for all of you who are saying, why does that have to be the case. I live in a tiny town with no resources and the nearest city is over an hour away. I can't do that. I don't have the money to be traipsing to the city everyday. I don't have the money to take online courses or anything like that. 
I think, I just feel like I'm trapped. I can honestly say that I never ever wanted to be a stay at home parent. Any job I do get, is going to pay for daycare, with nothing left over. I do not qualify for subsidy, I've already asked and applied. So It is just not worth it for me to get a job. I can't switch with my husband, because I would not be able to keep our family living, I don't have the skills, or the experience to get a quality job. (not minimum wage)
I usually am a happy go lucky type of person, with very few cares in the world, but today, today is just a hard day. I feel hopeless and helpless. And I know it is going to get easier, I really do, but, not today. And not anytime soon. Eventually.",True,
227,"Hello, all! This isn’t an advice about anything medical per-se but about my experience going to a midwife (more specifically a certified nurse midwife). It was my first time going to an OBGYN clinic (I am 21) and I knew I needed to go at this age (just received my registered nurse license). 
I am sensitive, I can definitely admit to that, but I didn’t feel very welcomed nor did I feel like I could tell the midwife that saw me everything (I really tried to, but felt dismissed).
First, she came in eating (which is fine, I can understand you’re hungry on a busy day), and then asked me what I was in for. I replied that it’s my first time at an OBGYN etc, then she asked about my periods. That was the subject I really wanted to talk about because my cycle itself isn’t too bad (normal cramping first few days) but my mood swings are really really terrible. I’d become really snappy to my family and boyfriend and just overall really terrible, so I wanted to ask for a birth control.
I described all of that and the midwife’s demeanor seemed to change. She was already very quick about her questions with me (again, understandable if she has a lot of patients to go through) but then she asked “so... do you want a birth control to alleviate your mood swings?”. This was a great path to the conversation I wanted to have about it because she brought it up first! 
I already told her that I wasn’t sexually active (still a virgin) but she didn’t let me go into the fact that even though I have a loving boyfriend of 1 year, I still chose to be a virgin, etc. I was really hoping to build that rapport with her and tell her that even though we love each other very much, the consequences of a pregnancy was too large so we decided to wait after marriage (I know, seems old-fashioned but I’m really proud of us youngsters for choosing this). 
The midwife never asked me anything about myself like that, and then she told me out of the blue “you know condoms are the best for sepux and preventing pregnancy right?” I was shocked, I told her of course I know (not in a rude way because I was still surprised by that statement). Then she asked where my pharmacy is because she prescribed Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets (Loryna) as she said it was the best for mood swings. That’s great! I told her which pharmacy my family usually picks up medication, but I realized after I should’ve stopped her there (I just didn’t know how to handle this new way of doing check-ups). Even though this birth control is just for mood swings, I really did not want my parents to find out (I’m under my dad’s health insurance) because it could come out the wrong way. We were finishing up (before she did a quick physical exam of my pelvic area and felt for lumps on my breasts), and I brought up the program “the Pill Club” where it’s convenient (they deliver to you) and it’s discrete. When I said the word discrete, the midwife became snappy (in my opinion, again I said I’m sensitive) and replied “well I already put it in, we can try that program after the three month supply of the birth control is up”. 
I was really sad because my plan to keep it from my parents (I’m an adult <span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 152, 162]'></span>) was ruined. 
I had to tell my mom (who is also a registered nurse), who is a more understanding parent than my dad, about the birth control (really really stressing the mood swings part). In the end, I felt really rejected by my first visit to the OBGYN. Her assuming that I might have been sexually active and lying to her about it, angered me because she could have just tried to build a rapport with me to get my full story. I tried to understand that patients lie all the time about what they’re ashamed of (i.e. smoking and alcohol) but I could have told her my personal values and would have known me better (especially for a first-time visit). Then the fact that she became snappy with me about the pharmacy place for the medication, made me feel even more dejected.
I’m definitely reconsidering changing to another OBGYN clinic, I just wanted to ask others for advice about my feelings towards this visit and if they were unfounded or not. Thank you for reading.",False,

I wish I had more control over his naps but I work full time and am never home with him during the day. 

The only thing I have control over is his nighttime schedule. However through the night is a literal nightmare. He's hard to get to bed. Usually we give him a bottle and rock him out but sometimes that doesn't work and I become frustrated and want to let him CIO but I can't handle it. 

Once he's to sleep he usually wakes up 2 times a night and sometimes he's wide awake at 4am. Usually I'll give him a bottle and he'll fall back asleep. If he's wide awake I take him downstairs and try endlessly to rock him back to sleep.

I know I shouldn't be giving him a bottle at night because he might just be waking up needlessly for a snack but I can't tell. And I know he doesn't know how to fall asleep on his own because I never taught him that.

Basically the whole situation is uncertain. I walked away with the thought that the whole attitude is ""we just have to see how it goes....."" 

For me I'd rather go vaginally with no pain relief because I'm so phobic about needles and unless I'm actually dying I will not have one.... 

If I go into spontaneous labour before 37 weeks I HAVE to have an epidural as the risk/difficulty to delivering the second twin is quite high, may need to deliver via forceps or have a c section anyway...plus can't effectively monitor both babies the way the hospital wants to... 

Basically both my babies are lying horizontally (at the moment) one under my ribs and the other above my hips in which if they don't move into position that's a c section which they plan to do at 37 weeks... 

I can choose to have an elective c section regardless of if I go into labour on my own or not (the way I see it is because it's twins they're just happy to cut me open... the whole attitude of the doctor was that basically the hospital would prefer to do so instead of anything else...)

Those who have had multiples have you been able to have a natural birth without issue? And for those who haven't have you been so ""limited"" in the options you're given by the hospital? I thought birth plans means what the mother wants... not what the hospital thinks is best that the mother has to pick from...  I'm so confused.

248,"Hey everyone! I was reading all the stories for the Kyleena insertions and updates over the weekend while waiting for my appointment so I thought I'd add my experience to the bunch~ TL;DR at the bottom. 

I had my appointment today around 1:45. My doctor prescribed me 2 misoprostol pills to soften my cervix since she said it's small/tight. I took it last night around 6pm and woke up at 6am to take the second one. I ate food around noon and then ran some errands before my appointment and took 400mg of ibuprofen around 1. I saw most people do 800mg and my doctor said that's fine, but I'm a little less than 100lbs and felt weird taking so much at once! 

Once I got into the office I had the usual nurse asking me questions and telling me to undress from the waist down. Then my doctor came in, explained the procedure and that there would be two cramps (one for the cervix cleaning and one for insertion) and asked if I had any questions. 

She got down to business! My doctor is superrr sweet and super, super efficient. The whole process from laying back to sitting back up after insertion probably took.... 5? minutes. Maybe a little less or little longer. The pain was not bad for me at all!! The speculum (or whatever it's called to open your vagina) was a little uncomfortable but the cleaning and insertion was exactly as she said-- just two cramps. To be honest, I didn't know she had even inserted it! I thought it was just her cleaning my cervix or something but it was over. I think the misoprostol and ibuprofen probably helped but I generally have a higher pain tolerance and I was expecting a terribleeee pain from all the stories I heard so it seemed very quick and easy compared to what I expected. 

Afterwords I was able to sit up and get dressed and I felt fine. When trying to make my follow up appointment though, the dizziness hit and it was BAD. Like nearly fainted and they escorted me back into my room and gave me water and a bag to throw up in. I was really, really surprised the dizziness hit me as hard as it did since I didn't feel like the insertion bothered me that much but c'est la vie! I drank some water, my boyfriend finished booking my appointment and he drove us home. 

I would really, really suggest having someone drive you. There's no way I could have driven home afterwords. I immediately got into bed once I got home because I was cramping pretty badly and I had started bleeding a little. I just lounged for a while and cuddled with my boyfriend. The cramps probably went away like an hour and a half after I got home. By ~4 I seemed pretty much fine. Still spotting but was walking around no problem and could barely feel any cramps. 

I'll try to update in a few months to see if I have any new updates regarding it! So far, I'm happy. PM me if you want any other info or have questions! 

TL;DR: Insertion was not nearly as painful as I heard/expected but I had 400mg of ibuprofen and cervix softener used. Got dizzy afterwords and felt like shit but then felt fine about 2-3 hours after insertion!",False,

I guess I just feel pressure -- whether self imposed or socially is yet to be determined -- to address my baby's needs and sooth him as immediately as possible; I am not sure if this is because I want to make sure my boy is happy at all times, or I just know what its like to be in public and have the persistent cries of a child become a mild nuisance to others. Anyway, so the story goes that I alone took my boy for a walk in the stroller, which we've done countless times to no major problems, and we decided to head towards a new coffee shop in the neighborhood I wanted to check out. I must have underestimated the walk, as the walk took longer than expected (1.8 miles one way in distance) and my boy plopped a #2 in his diaper. I always time feedings and diaper changes right before I go out in public, but on this day, my son was in rapid succession mode. So he starts to cry at level 7 soil meter and I'm about in a full blown panic because it was another 20 minutes to the destination and there just wasn't a changing station (or a public restroom in reasonable walking distance). I thought about changing him in his stroller/car seat but the angle, I was afraid, would do harm to his neck. While deliberating what to do next, his cry-o-meter is at def-con 10 alert level, and at this point I was in front of an apartment complex and attracting the attention of middle aged women; I felt their judgemental eyes boring into  me. So I did the only thing I could do: I found a patch of grass that was covered in shade, and laid his burpey towel, some rags, and changed him right there. I haven't heard my baby cry like this during a diaper change since he was in the hospital.  A lady even pulled her car up to make sure that everything was okay. I gave her the thumbs up and assured her that all my baby needed was a diaper change. Afterwards, I managed to get his diaper change lickety split and he immediately stopped crying and back to normal -- but damn it if the damage wasn't already committed to my self esteem. We made it to the coffee shop and enjoyed our time there, but my son still needed to have two more diaper changes before we could even make it back home! So, this was definitely a crash course of changing diapers on the fly in public, as I've been pretty fortunate to manage to time my outings around his bowel movements. But I guess today was one of those days. Just wanted to share and see if anyone else has similar experiences.",True,
251,"Hey fellow daddies. Haven't checked in with you all in a while. Hope your holidays are going a bit better for me. 

Not sure where to start. But I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with the holidays this year. It's significance cannot be overstated. It will be the first for our new family and my 10 month old. And it will also be the first without my Father-in-Law. So there are definitely mixed emotions going into this year. 

Another burden is the feeling of being stuck in the middle of my new family, and my external family (i.e. my mother). To give a little bit of background, she's been a bit persistent about asking what we are going to do about baptizing my son (I was raised Catholic). My wife and I chose to get married in non-denominational fashion (and I haven't practiced Catholicism for years) so we are making the choice in our pursuit of faith. Lets just say that this choice came as a HUGE disappointment towards my mother and I don't think we've ever recovered from it. 

So now my first born is basically battleground #2 and my mom has made overtures towards wanting to baptize my son, as well as advising us to attend RCIA courses (basically adult classes for a pathway to become Catholic). To fast forward, a few weeks ago my mom sent a text message asking if we can baptize my son the week of Christmas because we are having family in town and she thought it would be a great occasion. 

So I don't know how to thread this line without having to break off 2 halves of my entire family. My wife has been made to feel isolated and an outsider by my mother through her passive aggressive and lack of nurturing during the pregnancy (though it could just be my mom's nature). And I feel overwhelming guilt that I couldn't find some sort of resolution and I know there is probably going to be tension when we see everyone this Holiday. 

Just venting yall and seeing if anyone else going through the same drama -- religious or otherwise.

258,"Hey guys, my niece is almost 6 years old and she has cerebral palsy along with some sensory issues. She doesn’t like having her head or hair touched, she gets very tense and cries a lot, almost hyperventilating, even if my sister just gently runs a comb through it.

She also has trouble getting to bed and staying asleep through the night, I would say it takes her about 2-3 hours to fall asleep, sometimes she’ll even be up throughout the night. 

She likes to chew on things, we have a rattle with a soft end that we give her because she tends to wave her hands in front of her mouth and get spit on them, but she’s been doing a lot better with that lately. She also sucks on her wrist to go to sleep, I think it comforts her.

She doesn’t walk yet, doesn’t speak but she makes sounds and is sometimes able to respond to questions by shaking her head yes and no, but it’s not very consistent.

Christmas and her birthday are coming up soon and I was wondering if there’s any gift ideas you guys might have had, anything you would have liked as a child, something that might help her with her sensory problems or help her get to sleep?

After working as a doula and in various other birth roles for the past 7 years, I want to begin my journey to become a midwife. I'm very split about which route to take- CNM or CPM. The thing is, after attending hospital, home, and birth center births, I know I do NOT want to work in hospitals. So I'm drawn to the CPM route. However, I appreciate the geographical flexibility and better pay rates of CNMs. 

I hear of many CNMs saying they went to school with the intention of becoming a home birth midwife, but ended up working in hospitals once everything was said and done. Do any of you know of CNM programs have have a strong emphasis on training students in out-of-hospital settings, if that's what the student wants ?

267,"Hi Everyone.  

Need your advice please on feeding strategies.  Our triplets turn 18 months by end of this month.   Two of our girls are lagging behind in eating solids.   Here's where we are for the two: 

- Still taking bottles (80% regular milk, 20% formula) with plans to transition to 100% milk by October.  they take about 4 feeds / day. 
- They eat pureed food twice a day.  I try to make it as thick as possible (for morning one, I include cottage cheese in the mixed cereal to make it chunky).  They tolerate it well, but I don't notice much chewing action.    Afternoon feed is more smooth than the morning.  
- They don't pick up food and put it in their mouth.  They pick up the food fine, but just don't take it to their mouths.  I'm working with them daily to bring finger foods and sit and let them watch me eat some of the food.   Based on what I read online, I don't force them to eat, but let them watch and let them explore. No progress.  One holds on to the food in her hand, the other would try to nibble on the food, but eventually throws it away.   
- They don't hold sippie cups and won't even drink from it even If we try to feed them.  

We'll be seeing the pediatrician for their 18month checkup soon, and I'm considering asking for both of the kids to start therapy to improve their feeding.  

This is extremely frustrating and exhausting, and I need some advice on what has worked for you:

- For any of you who has gone through this struggle,  kindly share any tips that has worked, and how long did it take to notice change? 
- When is the best time to offer solids?  I read in forums on trying foods when they're hungry, very hungry. I think of the 1st morning feed as best option, but haven't tried it yet.  Do you recommend this?  or between feeds when when're not really that hungry?   
- any particular foods that worked well for your kids?

268,"Hi Fellow Parents! 

My son is almost 22. He has a 3 yr old son, himself. Given that he is a single parent, we have continued to let him live at home to make parenting and college studies easier. His father and I, (mostly me), help take care of his son when it's his week to have him.
However, I am beginning to worry that this arrangement is creating a ""failure to launch"" situation with him.  He doesnt pull his weight around the house, he pays no bills, so his part time job can pay for his son's needs, and he has been leaving us to play more of a parent role rather than a grandparent role to his son. We have discussed this imbalance of responsibility a number of times before, but his moving out may be the next step. I am just not sure if that is the right step. Thoughts are greatly appreciated!

274,"Hi Moms. I need your input. My daughter's diaper rash is becoming seriously frustrating. At the beginning of November, we had to switch childcare providers (due to our previous one moving out of the area.) We like our new provider very much but almost immediately our daughter had a diaper rash show up. Previous to this, she hardly had any issues. It was also around the same time that we gradually switched from breastmilk to cow's milk but the first two weeks, she was still entirely on breastmilk and the rash was present then. Over the past two months, we've looked at a myriad of causes. However, one fact seems to remain the same: The diaper rash gets worse at the sitters and almost immediately gets better in our care (within one or two diaper changes). There is another little boy at the same providers and his parents are dealing with the same thing. We took a week vacation around Thanksgiving where the rash was entirely cleared up but within a day of being at the providers home, it showed back up. 

How would you approach this? Any ideas on what could be causing it? Could it be a lotion or soap that the provider is using? We've talked with the provider about it and she does not seem concerned about it and thinks diaper rash happens. I'm to the point where I want to start looking for another provider. 

The diaper rash rarely seems to bother our daughter though and she's adjusted well so that seems a bit extreme. I just need ideas on causes and how you would talk with the provider regarding it without sounding too accusatory. I honestly can't figure out what is causing it...",True,discipline

For a grad class I am taking this fall and in preparation for my second baby, I have created the subreddit /r/birthstories to act as collection of these amazing tales. My hope is that it will give people the opportunity to preserve their stories as well as learn something in reading the stories of others.

**This subreddit is not limited to stories by mothers, either. I strongly encourage partners, grandparents, siblings, doulas, midwives, doctors, or anyone else who has been able to witness labor and delivery to share their perspectives.**

**If you have already written a birth story on reddit or elsewhere please consider xposting it to /r/birthstories!**


Please share stories of all kinds, because in honesty is where true learning will thrive. My hope is that in reading the variety of stories, parents who are expecting will learn some things to prepare and encourage them. Additionally, I hope that outsiders and women who have already gone through it will take on the understanding that birth is a completely personal and unique experience. Your story(ies) can be as general or as detailed as you like, writing casually, formally, or artistically.

It got me thinking maybe I should try to pump that breast to keep supply up. I'm debating whether to immediately give this milk to kiddo (within a day or two) or freeze it, depending on if I'm replenishing the supply quick enough. 

My concern on storage is this... she's 8 days old so I'm making milk for an 8-day old. I'll be freezing milk for an 8-day old. But
If I wanted to use this milk in... let's say in two months... then kiddo will need milk that I'd he producing at time that's made for 2 month olds and not 8-day olds. The composition, while edible and nourishing, is not really optimal?

Can someone explain how much they pump (to store) and why? Or point me to any resources that can help explain a process to implement on storing? Do you end up just feeding the baby a lot more pumped breastmilk? Do you feel it's only necessary to keep x number of days ""ahead?""

Now we have three cats and an almost 2 year-old (her birthday is in June). Our daughter loves the cats, she's good at petting nice-nice and respecting when they need ""quiet time"". Just within the last week has she able to reliably call them each by the right name. Usually though she just laughs and pets whichever ""kitty"" is closest. 

Today we found out one of the cat has a tumor and all we can do is palliative care for a few weeks. When that isn't enough, we will put her down.

So how do we explain this to our toddler? There is actually a chance we could get away with never explaining it. She doesn't usually see all three cats at once and never looks for a specific one. She's usually happy petting whichever is closest and most cooperative. 

What is developmentally appropriate? A gentle explanation about death? Or just letting her play with the two remaining kitties? FWIW we are religious and if we do go with an explanation it will include religion.

The past month or two they have gotten a lot harder to feed. It can take one twim like 40 minutes to finish a bottle at times, and sometimes we have to stop in the middle and give them a break. The pediatrician said they could be getting distracted so we assumed that was the problem. Sometimes they don't seem to want the bottle. They chew on it or play with it in their mouth instead of drinking. Sometimes they don't want it in their mouth, yet we keep gently trying, trying, trying, until they finally take it. We don't *force* the bottle into their mouth, but we keep gently trying to feed until they finally finish the whole bottle (or almost all), even if this means taking like a 5-10 min break.

Last week I found out my girlfriend is five weeks pregnant. We have been together for 8 months, and while we had both discussed the possibility of having kids, we definitely did not see or plan for it to come so quickly. 

The actual discovery was the biggest shock - during a routine medical check-up the doctor advised her to take a pregnancy test as she was adjusting her birth control. Low and behold - pregnant! We have since been to sexual health clinic and have had the pregnancy confirmed by a doctor. 

We have been processing over the last week and planning for what our not-to-distant future will look like with a child. There were obviously some tough questions but we have decided to purse with the pregnancy. Personally, I could not imagine a better partner to go on this journey with and I know she has what it takes to be a loving, supportive mother to my child. 

We are both fortunate to be have stable and secure employment. However, having just finished school myself, we are definitely not in the best place financially. We're on path to be debt free in a couple of months and will hopefully be able to build up some savings before the GF goes on maturity leave. Thankfully we live in a country that provides universal healthcare so that should be taken care of. Although we haven't told them (yet) I know we will have the support (financially and emotionally) from my parents. 

We are both very social people and I know this will come as a shock to our friends - most of whom are childless. We are not planning on telling anyone (with the possibility of our close family) until our 12-week ultrasound but I know navigating through some social situations will be tricky (especially with drinking involved).

With all of that said - I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and has any advice. I want to be there 100% for my GF and support her in anyway I can. I also want to make sure I am financially and emotionally prepared for whatever the outcome. If there is any literature/resources you can recommend it would be much, MUCH appreciated.",True,

The first time I suddenly wasn't able to pump, I inspected everything and noticed I had a hole in the diaphragm. There's your problem! Called Medela (i have a double pump from them) and they were wonderful. Had a new one in like a day.

The new pump was working great!....at first. Didn't turn it up all the way anymore, even bought myself a great handsfree bra. I was making on average 4oz per session (i usually pumped once a day at night after she was asleep).

Now suddenly I'm putting the pump at max and I'm getting dribbles out. If I hand express milk flows freely! But on the pump my foremilk starts for like 10 seconds and then stops and I never let down.

Changed flange sizes, membrabes are good, no diaphragm holes this time. I don't know what to do :( 

I'm pretty sure my supply is fine because she has plenty of wet diapers and is acting normal.

Any ideas? I only have 1 bottle left and I stuck it in the freezer. Unnngh.",True,child product

I just like to share an information about how important it is for our young learners to practice touch typing. Teaching children to touch type the right way has many advantages for their school performance. Touch typing, just like riding your bike and tying your shoelaces, is an explicitly learnt and eventually automatic skill.

By the time a student enters high school, 99% of assignments must be typed. And as students advance to higher grades, their typing assignments become longer and more numerous. This is a great cause of stress for students who are suddenly in a situation where the tools for their learning performance suddenly prove to be sub par. The hunt-and-peck method is irritatingly slow, typos eat up your study time, and you even start to feel that fingers become numb through excessive pecking on the keyboard.

I'm a first-time-mom of a 7.5 month old little boy. We've been bedsharing since day one since it was the only way he would sleep. For the first 6.5 months he would only sleep on my chest, which was sweet but really hard to maintain. In the past month he's started to seem to prefer nursing side-lying and will roll away when he's done to fall asleep on his own. This has been a major change and it's made quite a difference for my level of comfort. However, I have been going to bed with him at 7 every night and also lay down for all of his naps and I just don't think I can do it anymore. 
He's learning how to crawl now and what used to be a very easy bedtime routine (bath, book, nurse to sleep in minutes) has turned into a much longer routine because he is resisting sleep really hard for naps and nighttime AND he spends about an hour just flailing around and playing and practicing crawling all over me while popping on and off of my nipple until he finally decides it's time to sleep. 
With the early bedtime and multiple naps and with me laying down next to him for all of these he STILL seems to be tired throughout the day. He yawns all the time and gets really cranky throughout the day. 
I'm just starting to feel like sharing the bed might not be working for us. I love having him next to me and the ease of nursing him throughout the night, but the rest of it is beginning to take a toll on my well-being. 
I'm terrified to mess up all the good I've done by nighttime parenting him up until now, and I have no problem with continuing to nurse him during the night.. I just wish he could nap on his own and start the night off in his crib or somehow safely in our bed.

I’m a 20 year old female based in Australia who wants to study to become a midwife. Unfortunately, six months ago I lost my newborn son at eight days old.

I moved to an area with very hard (250ppm) water and a fancy LG front load washing machine and it has been tough figuring out how to get rid of terrible barnyard smell.  (We have ammonia issues too but that's another ball of wax.) Anyway, I've tried Biokleen, Tide F&amp;C liquid, Tide F&amp;C ultra stain release liquid, Tide regular liquid with OXI. added Borax, and alternately Calgon.  Did mighty bubbles washes and have bleached. The issue persisted until I ran across Foca and thought why not?  It is a powder and not rated for HE machines so the first try was a bit of a mess but after scaling back the amount quite a bit ( i think 2 TBSP vs the 1 cup!!!! they recommend will be sufficient) we are barnyard stink free!!! It's a miracle.  My ultimate preference is non-scented/plant based but let's be real. However, the fragrance is so light that after I air dry the diapers have no scent at all!  

Also, contrary to what I keep reading on diapering pages, liquids are better in hard water because they contain nonionic surfactants. See this research article [https://www.joe.org/joe/2011august/rb6.php](https://www.joe.org/joe/2011august/rb6.php) Yes, the foca I got is powder but I don't think this is the reason why it's magic.  They have a liquid formula that is HE rated which I will probably get when this powder runs out.  I know people love Tide powder, just wondering if other people with hard water second this research?

BM is extremely high conflict and is very close with hubs' family with whom he is not close (and is in fact no contact because of their abusive behaviors toward him). I recently discovered that her live-in boyfriend has gone to drug/alcohol rehab. The kids have not mentioned it but he has been there for at least one of their visits here.

Looking for a bit of advice and reassurance please!!

Im in the UK, live with my partner of 4 years (not married) and we have his 2 children every other weekend.

This weekend, their mother refused to pick the kids up, as agreed, as she was working until 8pm and did not want to drive after a long shift.

My partner explained that I had the car so he was unable to drop them off (she lives in a country village - not very accessible without a car)

Cue a torrent of abuse, ending in her refusal to collect them, stating she was calling the police if he did not bring them back.

His reply was that it isn't a police matter, to get a grip and come pick them up as arranged because he couldn't drop them off even if he wanted to.

Her answer was no and that she'll call the police in the morning (knowing it will be me alone with the kids as my partner starts work at 6.30am) 

If the police are called, what is likely to happen? I'm aware I don't have parental responsibility but we haven't refused to bring them home at all, she said she was picking them up so I took the car!

I have the texts which show her agreeing to pick them up, then last minute refusing and becoming abusive but will they even look at that?

I'm so worried that they will just remove the kids from me, they're only 7 &amp; 5 and would be terrified. And even if it was the police , I'm not overly comfortable with strangers taking them away in a car alone?

My partner is arranging mediation (for the second time) fingers crossed it comes soon.

EDIT - the police didn't come, she collected them alone.  She refused all attempts to clear the air, stated they are nothing to do with me, she knows we could have dropped them off and I won't be seeing them again.

320,"Hi, I have a sister. She’s going to be 28 this year, I’m 19. I don’t like to complain about someone or write bad things about anything about anything. But, I really need help. To introduce this situation, let me give a summary of her personality:

1. She likes attention, not like a popular kid but literally (she even told me once) wanted to be treated like a president of the country, aka playing master while our family acting like servants. 

2. She is (perhaps) arrogant and non-reflective. Once, oh wait, more than once. literally. Almost. Every. Single. Time. From what I said in personality number 1, she places herself important over others. For instance, she is almost 28 now, by this age I believe a number of people would probably be working already, planning their own dream and life goals. I respect my sister, I really do. But her arrogance such as constantly using my parents money spending on useless things really gives me and my parents anxiety. I don’t mind her using our parent’s money, but using over $300 for an app that can make her ‘famous’ (which is what she wanted) in Wordpress is seriously, to be frank, a horrible and idiotic idea. That IS my opinion of course. I understand she is arrogant because...if I have to think deep, she doesn’t want to face conformity, she doesn’t want to be ‘average’ I guess. But I feel so wrong that she keeps over spending money abroad which has a high currency compared what our parents earn in our home country. Plus, our parents are almost 70 now, mom has reduced mobility. I legit, feel so bad to even spend my parents money on buying other stuff, not even a subscription on Spotify. Because I understand how friggin hard it is to earn money. 

3. Obsessively competitive. Being competitive in a society is reasonable. But my sister is so obsessive in ‘winning’ me, meaning she wants me to lose in everything and she win. She’s the kind of person who would do anything to get what she wants. I can feel her thirst and malice of wanting me to end up in despair because I happen to have gotten birthday gifts from friends. She would keep comparing me with her to my parents, complaining non stop from day till the time we go to sleep. literally. I am not lying. She wants to have a better phone than me, more friends than me, etc. She wanted me to not live good life and I can feel it. And that’s just one of the situation of her wanting to defeat me in ‘having a better life’. She doesn’t have friends, but wait, the list keeps going on. NB, I always clearly, obviously show no interest in beating her in whatever what she wants to win in. She still does it anyway. 

4. I don’t like to be a rude person, but I am so surprised how undeveloped and insincere she is despite being sent abroad to study. She often told us that she wasn’t able to make friends, even if she do it doesn’t last long. Initially, we thought maybe the friends she made are toxic, but she’s the one who’s toxic. Real life situation here, she likes to keep having her friends treat her lunches even we do always constantly send her a large amount of money to enough for life expenses. Her reason of using her friend for free lunches, is so she could buy the latest Samsung tablet using the money we sent her. Even after treating her lunches, she wouldn’t even be grateful and keep being negative instead. Let alone a friend, she does this to her family too. 

5. Her greed. Ok look, I get it. Greed is human nature, but if you really cherish something, you might put that selfish attitude beside. Once, I was moving from my house to school dorm. Because I have 8 boxes of items, and needed help in moving to my new dorm, my mom asked my sister if she wanted to fly back, she said yes. And when she came back the first day, she did. Not. Help. At. All. Ok, that’s fine, maybe you’re tired so you didn’t help, but every time I open the boxes to unpack my stuff, she’ll shove me over, or push me aside, and without my consent, shoves her in into the box and touch anything that caught her interest. If I’m lucky, she just touches it. Worst case scenario, she complains why I get to have it and grabs it for herself. Example, I have a few extra exercise books, she takes it. 

6. She is not reflective at all. Because she’s abroad, we haven’t gather as a family for almost 3 years. We met her yesterday after a 14 flight, we were happy that we are going to meet her, but sadly, she ends up complaining non stop and fighting with our parents on DAY 1. FYI, today is only DAY 2, and her actions are becoming lethal, seriously. 

7. She stalks. She stalks my friend lists. Gossips about them, worst come to worst, trash talk me by messaging to my friends.

8. Money lover. Always uses parents money. We nicely asked her to try and work to start supporting herself because our parents aren’t immortal, but she didn’t and even came up with bad excuses of not doing it.

9. Her jealousy. Literally. 

10. Many more, but too tired to even think so much about her negativity.

Like I just said, today is just day 2 of us meeting my sister. Because her seek of attention is so deep, she keeps complaining and comparing me with herself. She had a better life before me, before I’m born, our parents bring her to 5 star hotels to eat buffet. She had 3 servants serving her. She can do whatever she wants. She get new things, I get hand-me-downs (until I am 16). Lots more. Every time, I try to be a good sister, as always be considerate, every time if I want to buy something, I’d think about her if she needs anything abroad or would sometimes ask her if she ever needed help in anything. If she’s studying, I didn’t bother her or anything. I respect her even though knowing she doesn’t really like me much and is jealous of me. But today, her toxic personality made my almost 70 go mad, she almost had a heart attack after scolding her. I tried to tell her to not to scold because sometimes scolding makes a person develops worse. But after seeing our mom almost died because my sister can’t ‘get over things’. I had enough. It’s been 19 years, and I need advice, and I need serious help. I don’t care, I let her do anything she wants with me, my stuff, I don’t care if she already ruined my childhood,etc. please, I just wanted to live a simple human life.

I’m feeling very anxious about this even though it’s early days yet in my pregnancy with  #2 so forgive me if this turns into a nervous ramble.

I’m wondering what your experience was like when delivering #2? We bedshare and BF and I have no plans on stopping either and my son is very attached to both me and my husband.

I prefer to keep toddler with us in the room as he has never stayed with anyone else and I would be worrying myself sick about how he was coping if he wasn’t with us... is that a thing? Can your kids stay with you in the room? 

My plan is to have him with us while I labor and have my sister take him out while I push and then... bring him back in where we can all stay together for the remainder of the stay?

This is all very new to me as I had a homebirth with my first! I would 1,000% do a homebirth again but unfortunately I had a trapped placenta and had to be immediately transferred to hospital by ambulance for blood loss and to get a D&amp;C.

She is primary care giver and I have him (no overnights yet) 80% of weekends and see him 2 add'l nights during the week.

For background, SO and I have been married for 2 years. He has 50/50 of his two children, SS8 and SD13. SO and I are both in our 30s  From reading this sub I've determined that I'm quite fortunate that my circumstances are comparatively low conflict. The kids are decent, SO is mostly supportive, if a bit clueless, and although BM doesn't like me she and I are cordial and pretend we don't despise each other.

My issue is that I feel that my every action is being judged by the kids and BM. BM has a history of critiquing practically everything about me to my SO, and presumably to the kids too. She didn't approve of the division of labor in our home, felt it was unfair to my SO and was telling him he ""could do better"" Ugh. That went on for about six months, but thankfully she's stopped. Her opinions seem to have influenced the children though.

From the beginning I was clear with my SO that I wasn't there to be the maid or nanny. In the first year I drastically cut back on the amount of cooking and cleaning I was doing because I was doing the lion's share in addition to working full time and making a larger financial contribution and getting little to no acknowledgement or appreciation. By no means do I leave all of their care to him, I help out quite a bit in my opinion and my income has definitely improved their standard of living. The kids however seem to think that because I'm the woman I should be doing the bulk of household chores and make occasional vague, judgmental comments. That, combined with BM's history of essentially calling me lazy makes me feel like I'm under a microscope and everything I do, or don't do, in my own home is judged.

I hate feeling that I can't just relax and be myself in my home. Even though I love my husband very much and our relationship is quite strong. I am really missing living on my own. I hate the constant pressure to be better or do more. I miss my home being my sanctuary. I miss being able to just relax and be myself. I miss my house being clean (they are slobs).

337,"How to raise a successful and happy Kids

Childhood times are the best time to learn &amp; raise successful and happy Kids. In some way or another, an individual’s appreciation is at its top during childhood. Guardians should use these learning a long time to inspire the estimations of life in their kids.

In case you’re a parent, train them positive abilities with the goal that they will know and see the magnificence that life brings to the table. Make them eager about existence. Give into their souls and minds every one of the miracles and eminence of being alive by living to its fullest in a positive manner to raise successful and happy Kids.

 

#### Kids learning

There’s a startling contrast between kids learning through self-revelation, and kids learning through self-disclosure with appropriate direction. The primary things that kids learn are generally the things that stay with them and shape developmental years until they arrive at adulthood.

Let us guess you let your kids learn through self-revelation. Somewhat, self-disclosure is great since it grows full freedom and confidence. Be that as it may, the learning procedure may be moderate. As it were, it resembles an experimentation experience for youngsters. They need to isolate the great from the awful, the privilege from an inappropriate, what they like and what they don’t. All things considered, what they will like are the ones that come simple to them or the ones that they appreciate the most. What’s more, the ones that they appreciate the most may not really be the great ones. Without a certain direction, what they like and appreciate the most may really be harming them despite the fact that they don’t know about it. Maybe later, on the off chance that they discover that they chose unsuitable decisions, it might be past the point of no return.

With self-revelation through appropriate direction, you will have the option to leave space for them to create freedom and confidence. Together, give them what is correct and what’s up. Disclose to them why. In the event that conceivable, refer to incidents or models dependent on compatible with life occasions to make them all the more persuading and fair.

The more sensible they are, the more effectively the kids are satisfied. In like manner, take a stab at showing them in a friendly and funny environment. Kids are progressively mindful and anxious to realize when every (both instructor and Students) are in a simple state of mind. You will know and feel their enthusiasm to learn through the radiance in their eyes and by the manner in which they answer your inquiries. You can be certain that what they gain from you is adequate for them and will remain with them. That is the reason, as a parent, you should show excitement in life to your kids.

#### Self-revelation

There’s a third strategy for causing youngsters to learn. That is through appropriate direction leaving insignificant space for self-revelation. However, there are disadvantages. You detract from them the advantages of confidence and freedom. The direction you commit to them might be great and well-proposed, however, they should not depend on you on nearly all that they do. They become choice reliant on you. There are cases wherein this sort of direction may be more regrettable than giving no direction by any means.

There are guardians who experienced hardships during their childhood, strived, and became effective monetarily. Despite the fact that they are monetarily in the situation to guide and help their kids to a superior life, they lean toward that their kids experience the equivalent troublesome experience they experienced during their more youthful years. Their explanation: with the goal that their youngsters will esteem and experience very similar things they experienced. This might be appropriate to obstinate and insubordinate adolescents, yet not very taught ones. For what reason should their children and little girls rehash similar troubles? There’s no motivation to. This resembles rebuffing the guiltless. Rather than rehashing the experience, they ought to gain from it. Life is too short to even think about repeating disagreeable encounters.

Perhaps the most ideal approaches to widen your kids’ information about existence is by voyaging. The world – its changed individuals, places, and societies – has a great deal of data to offer. It is maybe as significant as the traditional homeroom. In the event that you are monetarily capable, voyaging is a standout amongst other informative encounters you can give your kids. Search for shows or world fairs, and take your kids there. Books are the following best things. It’s going by reading.

Fill your kids with contemplations of pride, self-confidence, and an uplifting mentality so that there will be no space for negative thought. All the more critically, fill their reality with giggling, love, and comprehension. You’ll never turn out badly. it’s a really good thing to raise successful and happy Kids.

339,"Husband and I are atheist. He's buddhist atheist, and I'm kind of agnostic atheist. I've always known we were eventually going to have some sort of issue with my parents and our kids, because my family are very devout evangelicals. 10 or so years ago I think I told my mom I was either atheist or I didn't know what I believed, and that's all we've said about it since. We had a secular wedding (but were married by my cousin's husband, who is a pastor, mostly for my family's sake though it was not requested- I did it mostly to avoid the issues that would arise if we did something else and we just didn't really care). 

So far we've said nothing about religion to our kids. They believe in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, as well as elves, dragons, and unicorns, because they're 4 and reality vs imagination is a loose concept. Almost 2 months ago, I joined my husband on a business trip along with our youngest (9 month old) and the 4 year old twins stayed with grandma as they had often before.

This time was a little different. One of the first nights back I was eating dinner with them and they started telling me about Jesus and how god lived in the sky. I was taken aback- totally not prepared for this yet and certainly NOT prepared for my 4 year olds to start evangelizing to me in my house at dinner. So, flying by the seat of my pants I blurted out that god was pretend, but Grandma thinks he is real and we need to respect that. But he's just pretend. Pretend is a concept they are just beginning to pick up- they certainly play pretend games now, and they watch Daniel Tiger where he pretends as well, so it's a concept I'm hoping they can use as a framework for religion. 

I talked to my husband about it later and he liked what I said, so every time it's come up again (and it has, many times) I try and gently remind them that god is pretend. 

Recently we were walking home from preschool and my daughter was listing all the things she loved. She ended it with ""and I love god!"" My son turns to her and says ""god is just pretend, Emma."" He sounded rather sad or maybe I'm just reading into it, but it made me feel bad/mad. I'm sad that I have to crush this fantasy but I'm mad at my mom for obviously laying it on so thick. She must have been showing them several movies a day, praying with them, and singing songs to them (don't get me started on my daughter singing Jesus Loves Me).

I know we need to set boundaries, but it unfortunately also means confronting my mom's denial/my lack of clarification to my family of my atheism, so thinking about it is making me intensely uncomfortable. I've sat down with my husband and hammered out what we want the boundaries to be (no telling the children bibles stories/ showing them movies, no teaching them christianity). I've just not figured out yet how to have the conversation. My family lives about 3 hours away so it will likely be over the phone.

I feel so guilty today. It has definitely been the most stressed day due to my child, that I have ever had. 

The past two nights she has gotten up and screamed and cried until past midnight. I really enjoy the time she goes to bed until I go to bed. A couple hours to myself and to decompress, my me time. So not having that has been difficult on top of not getting a good night sleep. 

Today was just terrible. She had tantrum after tantrum, didn’t want to be held, but screamed and reached for me whenever I put her down. She wouldn’t nap, just all around miserable. I’m pretty sure it’s her teething, she isn’t sick and has no fever. I do feel bad that she is in pain, I even gave her ibuprofen, which I rarely do, which didn’t seem to help much, maybe a couple hours. 

I just kept wanting this day to be over, and I kept thinking how I wish I could just be away from her for a few hours. That her father would just come get her and I could be alone. Sitting here rocking her, I am content and happy I could be here to comfort her, but today was just so overwhelming. I kept thinking I couldn’t do this and I was just so stressed.

341,"I  was adopted out pretty much from day dot. I was born with special  needs, and grew up with so much shame from that. All my other siblings  in my adopted family are able bodied so I always sort of envisioned that  they were at least loved, and maybe their reasons for being adopted was  being born out of wedlock or in poverty or whatever. But being given up  because you were disabled, that screwed me up for a long, long time.

I  was told that I had an older sister and a younger sister. And that my  father threatened to leave my mother if she kept me, and they told their  family I had been stillborn. Now, I don't know how much of this is  true, but that's what I lived with through my childhood up until a few  years ago when I started to realise life was complex and people are  complex too, and that someone isn't always just a victim or a hero or a  villain.

I've kind of always wanted to  know things, but I kept telling myself I would look into it after I  graduated postgrad. After I was a published writer. After I was so many  things that made my disabledness pale away. Truthfully, I'm not sure if I  ever would have. The fact I'm disabled makes me feel so much shame,  even when I thought I was over that.

ANYWAY,  long story short, last week I got a message on Facebook from a young  man. Who turned out to be my brother. And it ended up I didn't have a  younger sister, but him, a younger brother. And he said that it had  taken him so many years to build up the courage to contact me and he'd  been looking at my profile for years. And that my bio mother had kept  all the articles in newspapers of me growing up.

And  we were getting along so well, and it sounds really stupid, but I was  starting to get attached really quickly. I had a kid brother! And I  found the rest of my family on Facebook through him (I haven't messaged  them) and it was just trippy as all hell.

And then he stopped messaging me. After a friendly conversation, it just severed to a halt and he hasn't replied. He has not read the message, but I've seen that he's been online a few times. I think if he'd read it, I wouldn't feel so lost. 

And it's stupid but it feels like if he's lost interest, I feel abandoned  all over again and in a situation I didn't even begin and wasn't quite  emotionally prepared for.

Most of my kids get along ok with SO. There isn't much of a parenting role as he came in the picture when they were all older and he's not really interested in being a parent to them. He's more like an uncle to them, which I'm ok with.

My most stubborn child, a daughter who is 13, absolutely hates him. She can't say why, she will readily say there is no particular reason. She just hates him. I'm guessing it has a lot to do with the fact that we all moved in together very close to when their Dad died and she hasn't really processed her Dad's death at all. So rather than feel that, she just funnels all that pain into hating SO. That and she's always hated change and resisted anyone else getting my attention.

I know that some kids just don't develop relationships at this age with a step parent. I'm not trying to push that. But she is now refusing to go to a planned family weekend at my grandparents cabin because he'll be there (idk where she thought he would be, of course he's coming).

She then asks for me to hand her my ipad (once again my property that I payed for with my two jobs as of right now) I reluctantly handed it to her because I though maybe she wanted to just sit down and watch YouTube or something and didn’t have her phone. She immediately opens the settings and goes onto WiFi and after realizing that I had the setting off (I do this to lower ping) she demands I hand her my phone. The same deal happens and I had WiFi off. She then goes for my xbox and tells me to go into settings. She instantly demands that I turn it off as I must be wasting the WiFi (what the actual fuck) I refuse and then I show her my bandwidth usage for the last 7 days it isn’t even a whole gigabyte. She goes behind my tv and pulls the plug out of my console when I was in the middle of a PUBG game. What she failed to remember is that she has her phone, her laptop, two TVs, and her fucking iPad on the internet at all times. I explain this to her and these were her exact words “so what, I pay for it so I can do it” I explained to her that this is technically true, but that if my one device was “wasting the WiFi” then why hasn’t she realized that it was her the whole time. I told her this and her responses as that since my Console was bigger it must take more WiFi. Does she think it’s a fucking currency or something?

My mom and I have been solely paying the rent and bill's ( younger brother just got a job and helps how he can). 
We were notified by the homeowner that they want to sell. We have until May to move out. We put in an application for a home that would accommodate all of us.(It was denied today by the way) 

While turning in the applications I noticed how much money my older brother makes. And I was furious. I have a ok job but doesnt pay very much.

363,"I am lost and in need of some outside perspective.

Some background:  My husband and I joined the military together in 2009.  By 2012, my husband had been injured and was receiving at 60% disability rating from the military, and I was pregnant.  We sat down and agreed on our perspective roles - He said he wanted to be the SAHP and take care of our baby, while I said that was fine, I would get a job and support us.  We discussed what the SAHP job entails for me to be happy...

Our son taken care of (fed, cleaned, clothed, entertained), the laundry, dishes and the house kept livable. (I am not a clean freak by any means, but I do expect that bathrooms are cleaned once every other month or so...)  I got a job working Graveyard shift at a hospital and our son was diagnosed with Autism at age 2.  He is now 4 and was recently enrolled in very expensive private school specifically for autistic children.   

Now the reality:  My husband will lock my son into his room for hours on end.  I would say my 4 year old spends the majority of his time playing on the IPAD.  During that time my husband will spend hours playing video games in a adjacent room.  I do not believe my husband has cleaned a bathroom once since my sons' birth (its gets bad, I yell, he ignores, defeated I do it myself - cycle continues next time it gets bad)  I am unsure why we even bothered buying a dresser as my husband believes clothes do not need to be folded/put away - if they are clean but slightly damp (because he realized all our clothes were dirty and started 1 load of laundry a few hours before I needed to go to work) that's good enough.  *BTW - going to work at 10 pm in damp clothes on winter nights is the best treat ever!* And he has taken to buying big stacks of paper plates so he has something clean to eat off of because the sink is usually full of dirty dishes.

I have tried talking to him, his mother has come up, seen our place and tried talking to him, he will promise to do better and a week later everything is the same.  If and when I complain about it, he tells me ""I'm hurt and can't do the chores"" ""if you want it done, you do it"" or ""why don't you do more work around here then?""

Society seems to blame me for his shortcomings.  When my husband is late to pick up my son from school, I get a phone call asking when I will be there (in the middle of when I am sleeping of course), when my husband fails to make doctor appointments and keep them, the offices phone me and want commitments which I cant give them without either not sleeping or not going to work.  When people see how my son is living they look at me with disgust and ask me how am I allowing this to happen...

I feel completely trapped and helpless.  I love my husband but I feel like he is using me to enable his bad behavior and I don't feel like there is anything I can do about it.  People I have talked to have suggested just letting things go until he picks up on the fact that I'm not going to bail him out, however this means the house becomes a disaster as he doesn't get that ""hint"".  I have threatened divorce, he shrugs.  I believe he knows that I cant leave him without further harming my son.  (How do you take care of a autistic child when you work all night and sleep half the day without massive amounts of money to pay for specialized childcare?)

I, myself, suffer from depression.  I often have thoughts of ending it but again, that would only hurt my son.  So day after day I muddle along.  I am unhappy with our current living situation but I have yet to come up with a solution that doesn't involve having to pull him out of a school that is doing so much for him.

380,"I ended up making contact with my biological mother back when I was 30. My primary reasoning was medical history though curiosity played a part as well. Little did I know how much I would learn. The most important part was that my biological father and my mother's grandparents all died in their late 50's and early 60's of heart related issues. I'm not the healthiest guy in the world but I felt and continue to feel great so this came as quite a shock. I immediately went in and got blood work and various other tests done. Passed them all with no issues.

Fast forward six years to this past week. I went in to an urgent care for a hand injury and they checked my blood pressure. It was through the roof. I've had it checked effectively yearly and it's always been around 120 over 85 so this was a bit nuts. I explained my medical history to them and was urged to go follow-up with my primary physician asap. Needless to say I've got an appointment today to get more work done and I don't really care about my hand anymore. I'm 36 years old, this should not be happening.

I've made some comments on here that were, according to reddit's upvote/downvote system, somewhat controversial in that I believe adoptee rights come before birth family rights as far as contact or getting information goes. This is an example of why. Prior to my birth state changing the laws regarding original birth certificates there would have been no way for me to get my family medical history as none was submitted. That changed in 2009 but the majority of states still have insane barriers that adoptees have to jump through and most of the time they end up hitting a wall without getting any useful information.

388,"I got an unexpected visit from the state investigator today at work. 

My son's mother moved into my parent house, where I was living (long story, tl;dr her apartment burned down), and then she changed her address to that location (and made my life a living hell in the process). A month or two after she moved in, I got my own apartment. That was back in October.

She's been living there since, and I've been here at my new place, but I kept my old address for vehicle registration, taxes, all of that - it is, after all, my parent's house, so I figured I'd avoid the hassle and just pick up my mail during child transfer times.

I guess this tripped the ""fraud"" trigger at DHS, since she has been receiving food assistance and medicaid, while telling them the truth - that I didn't live there. Apparently they don't believe her, since she's now under investigation - hence the visit.

Fortunately I provided my rental lease, and they talked to my landlord, so they have proof of residence for me. 

Technically, I'm the one who has done something not quite legal, by not updating my residence within 30 days. Somehow I made it to the age of 32 without knowing that was a deal - I've moved out of my parents house plenty of times over the last twenty years, and I've moved in just as often. No one has hassled me about it until now.

395,"I had my baby 7 weeks ago by non-elective caesarean after 3 days of labour. While I would never judge anyone for having a caesarean, elective or not, I was devastated as I'd really been looking forward to experiencing a vaginal birth. I didn't expect it to be pleasant, but I wanted to do it! While I understand the decision was made in the best interest of my baby and me, I'm still sad about the outcome, and my midwife is organising a review with the delivering obstetrician so that I can hear all the cold hard medical facts from the person who made the call and ask him the questions I wish I'd thought to ask at the time.

I plan to ask:

* exactly why they weren't willing to let me continue labouring
why he thinks I had so much trouble dilating in my own and why swelling on both my cervix and baby's head became an issue when we did eventually make progress
* why he said I would be a good candidate for a vbac next time (he gave reasons but I was crying and don't remember them)
* what can I expect when attempting a vbac (as in, I want to have reasonable expectations next time rather than just latching onto the positives)

I don't want to be thinking of more questions after the meeting and wishing I'd thought of them earlier so, if you had a non-elective caesarean, what questions would you want answered? 

What I didn't mention in my original post (though it's probably very obvious) is that I would dearly love to achieve a vbac for our next (and last) baby. So I really have two reasons for requesting this review: 1. I'm hoping that I can be more accepting of the c-section and 2. I want to manage my expectations for next time. Maybe I'm not a good candidate for a vbac and if so, I want to know this now so I'm well-prepared for it when the time comes.

Thanks to the posters at C-section Central, I've added the following questions to my list:

* Did the OB use a single or double layer of stitches to close up the incision?
* How long should I wait before trying to get pregnant again?
* What are the criteria for being considered as a candidate for a vbac?

396,"I had my child during the last semester of my undergrad. During that semester I still managed to get a 4.0 and attend graduation. I graduated with an English degree. My plan was to go overseas and teach English. During my first trimester (of pregnancy), I even interned at a university in Seoul, SK teaching English :)

I just don't know how to function anymore and it bothers the living hell out of me. I substitute teach now and I don't want to be a full-time English teacher for U.S. students. I know it'll be 12-hour workdays for a loooong, long time... maybe 2+ years. And I don't have a teaching certificate, so I'd need to go back to uni for it. I just view teaching in U.S. schools as incredibly soul-sucking. Even though I know the joys of loving ""your kids (students),"" I'm terrified of the burnout.

I tried going back to school and took a semester of anatomy and physiology, thinking I'd go into healthcare as a PA or RN. PA was the initial plan, but I chickened out. RN is ok, but not too appealing to me.

I then switched to school psychology (master's) and freaked out when I learned almost 95% of the job is assessment for special ed. Then I thought about school counseling -- but honestly I'm worried I won't feel enough meaning in that role. And I've heard the job outlook is awful. 

A huge goal of mine is to be present for my son and to be financially stable, yet happy. He is already 1.5 years old. I just don't know what to do... I feel sort of paralyzed.

399,"I had to mind these two kids from about 19:00 to 24:00 for my neighbors who I’ll refer to as kid 1 and kid 2. Kid one was 11 and kid 2 was 9. 

I let them stay up to about 22:00 and then told them it was about time they should go to bed. About 15 minutes after sending them to bed I peaked into kid 1’s room to see if he was asleep. He was wide awake and when he saw me he threw a bucket full of mud at me. I wasn’t really sure how to discipline him so I just told him to get back to bed now he’d played his little prank.

My shirt was soaking and my hair was completely covered So I put a towel on my head and waited a while until I thought they’d be asleep before I could go get a shower to try wash it out.

At around 10:30 I got into the shower and tried washing it out. Once I finally got it all out I went into the parents room where I had left my clothes, they weren’t there! I looked around for a bit but couldn’t find them. I put my towel on and went to ask kid 1 where he put my clothes, he wasn’t in his room. I looked around the house for a bit and when I looked out the living room window I saw him standing out on the porch. I opened the front door to try and call him inside but just as I did I had my towel yanked off and I was pushed out the door by kid 2. 

I was in shock and tried to cover myself while kid 1 ran around the back of the house where his brother let him in. They taunted me from the livingroom window as I begged them to let me in but they wouldn’t. I grabbed a plant to cover myself and ran around the back to check the back door but it was locked too. I checked the shed which was also locked and ended up dropping the plant and smashing it’s pot. I snuck back around to the front hoping nobody would see me and begged them to let me in again but they wouldn’t. I had a lightbulb moment and remembered I hadn’t checked the garage door yet. I checked but yet again, locked. I was all out of options so I eventually ended up wearing the doormat and having to ask the neighbors to make them let me in. It was humiliating to have the neighbors see me like that but yet again I wasn’t sure how to discipline them and just told them to go to bed, which they finally did.

Once they were away I took off the doormat and went to the kitchen to grab another towel, it was just my luck that at that moment their parents arrived home early with guests! I put my hands over my you know where and tried to explain myself.

We have some Tommee Tippee right now with the slowest-flow nipple and although she accepts it when she's VERY hungry, she definitely doesn't like it. She spits most of the milk out, it makes her almost more angry than not feeding her at all, and it doesn't seem to matter if the milk is fresh and the bottle warm or not.

When I do pump, as long as she's nursing on the other boob, I can generally get 3.5-4oz from one boob in 10 minutes.

Some of the major conflicts in our household tend to revolve around breaks for us - neither of us can seem to decide on what's fair.  I am a stay at home mom, I try to cook nice meals every day (almost), and I also work part-time at home for around 8 hours a week.  He works from about 7:30am until 4:30pm at an office.

Because we have twins, it's not just double the effort of having one toddler...in a lot of ways it's much harder.  It makes some things just impossible altogether, at least at this age.  We can't afford daycare and I don't particularly want to do that anyways.  I can't leave the house very much for car, financial, and lack of friends with kids reasons.

In our new schedule I want to try to have sufficient breaks for me, for him, and family time with everyone.  I think we all need this so we can plan ahead and so that I can actually plan to get out of the house once in a while.  I have a good idea of how I want to schedule the day for the kids, and have plenty of activities to do with them.  So this is definitely more just for us.  But I'd love to see other family's daily schedules!

I tend to think (and he's admitted) that his going to work from 7:30am to 4:30pm is not the same as me chasing around two wild toddlers by myself...he is having an entirely different experience at his office.  It's barely stressful, he's sitting all day, he can surf the web, he can take lunch breaks, go wherever he wants, and interact with adults.  So I tend to think that I ""deserve"" more breaks when he gets home.  He doesn't always think so.  

I do think it's important that we have more family time where we are both interacting with the kids, instead of one or the other parent just taking a break when we're both here.  I think that's important for them.

I definitely could be looking at this the wrong way and I just want some insight from other parents!  And maybe some mathematical equation for who's ""working"" more.  Ha :)  Hope this doesn't come off as me complaining too much, I am just a stressed out mommy looking to organize her life.  :)

He tells me he ""hates"" other kids, except for his siblings (also has an infant sister).

As a SAHP, this is extremely isolating for me. He doesn't play well with kids at play groups, etc., so there's no ""in"" to make play dates with other parents the way there was with my first. We always had something to do with my first, because he got along with everyone, so if I also liked the parent, we'd get together! Now we are home most of the time unless I'm in the mood/have the stamina to helicopter him through social situations.

He's very intense/spirited. He's also very bright, high language abilities, extremely active. If he can find a similarly energetic/spirited kid, or an older kid, he tends to do better. But often it seems other kids are put off by his energy and intensity. He's also very tall/strong for his age, so all of these behaviors can be perceived with less compassion than they might if it were clear he is just three years old.

We do play groups occasionally, go to activities with older brother, Sunday school, early childhood family education. He was in a small preschool, but I didn't think it was a great fit because it was a small classroom of all same-age kids, and I thought he'd do better in a mixed age classroom, which I have yet to find in a quality setting.

So far, I have been able to teach him addition. We initially started with touch points, but he was not quite able to grasp the idea of hitting spots multiple times to get the value. We have started using a new method I invented called the block method, which is basically just drawing a 3x3 grid and filling in the right number of dots as the value of the number. He has grasped this pretty well and is doing decent with it, though he is not always accurate when filling in the dots himself. ( I can send a picture of a worksheet I made him if anyone wants to see it.) I'm not sure how to convert this to money skills or how to start teaching him to add double digits together.

428,"I have sheltered my kids from much of what I had to deal with as a child.  My parents did the bills in the kitchen when we were up and we heard all the problems with money and heard about money problems if we asked for anything.  As a result, I grew to try to save my parents money by asking for cheaper things for christmas, and saying I wanted a pair of shoes after I had found the cheapest possible shoes.  Same with cloths.  To this day I get things much cheaper than I need to and value going to the thrift store for my cloths, even though I don't need to.  

My parents would rant about politics and the ""end times"" frequently causing me much worry over it.  

The result was an adult that feels guilty over buying stuff for myself, guilty over not getting my kids things they want for what ever reason, and stressed over political issues way to much.  

I have until now sheltered my kids from any money problems and political dissidence.  That changed for my oldest, 11, when SOPA became an issue.  He is a computer freak like I am and as such could not avoid the banter and drama about it.  I was worried about him getting to concerned with it and worrying to much.  At 11 you shouldn't have to much to worry about save how long you get to stay up and how much computer time you get.  

He responded in a fashion I hadn't expected, by joining the fray and on his site making an anti-sopa board and it drew in several dozen other users to link up and do the same.  I was very proud.  But then he asked me when I was going to explain the law to my 9 and 7 year old children.  

Now, this one is easy.  They aren't computer oriented much yet, so this law doesn't effect them.  But it got me thinking.  When is the right time to open up the world as it is to a child? I'm naturally protective and worry that they will end up naive to the world if I don't.  On the other hand I refuse to introduce a world to them that could cause unnecessary worry and/or guilt.

The thing is, my mother is arriving in the country to stay three weeks with us. It would be nice for her (and eventually my husband) to be able to have quality time alone (feeding) the baby and even nicer for me to be able to get out and have a life. Therefore, I'm considering introducing the bottle once or twice a day. 

I have heard conflicting advice on this. Some say that the baby will start refusing the breast (Not sure if this will be a problem for us...for now, the baby seems happy to engage in sucking motions when she's starving.) The pediatrician said that if I'm still exclusively breastfeeding at 3 months, the risk is that the baby will refuse the bottle. Therefore, she advises introducing the bottle from time to time. 

Friends tell me that pumping and dealing with washing and warming up bottles is a pain and I should keep breastfeeding until it's really become a problem for me.

The next morning we came back and they couldn't see anything in my uterus and we were told to prepare for an ectopic.

he goes in the bed room and puts on an extra accessory. All without washing his hands.

so picture ,birdys mom is in the hallway with a shirt shes mending in her hands. 


she pulls a janet Jackson in scream face, but birdy still doesn't wash his hands. 


My daughter says 


Oye for other peoples sake, just go wash ya hands nuh



to that birdy starts touching the shared earphones, removing them from a phone he was given. 



My daughter then says 


M: Well Im gonna rince these off birdy is so utterly nasty. 

Birdy : no youll harm them 


Birdys mom : aye leave the headphones alone M theyre not yours 


M: I guess, but I have to use them hes nasty, and youre letting him get away with far too many disgusting things



Birdies mom : Youll know when you have youre kids some year




M (in bed room cleaning headphones now): but my kids if they ever happen wont be so incapable and not even trying of doing any chores. And I have to do way too much things for your kid. Leaves the table in an horrible mess and Im the one who has to clean it up by myself 9 times out of 10.


(Birdies mom did say something like , birdie, you let M do the cleaning for you way too much and you dont lift a finger to help....unquote but  , since shes said that nothing has changed, except maybe he pours his pancakes into the pan while birdiesMom does pretty much everything else) 



Another exchange about wipeing things off with alcohol being useless





what happened with birdy pretty much is that, I guess he looked young for his age his whole life... think bindie Irwin so his parents and relatives did everything for him and now he doesn't want to do any chores pretty much. 


Coming to think about it, birdies moms criticizims and punishments to M, when she tries to do something like cook and messes up washing the bowl a lil bit ( small speck of flour on the side of the bowl, similar to what my grandma would leave on her bowls when her eyesite was failing) Has been mentioned as a scaring birdy from trying point. 



but theyre others on island who have the same 22 but look 6 problem that birdie does, and they help with cooking cleaning moping washing in the washing machine , and on and on. 


its annoying. Birdies also been called the king of being late by one of his teachers no lie. Thats a symptom of male dyslexia, but they haven't opened any dyslexia testing centers on island yet. 



so now, birdy has gotten a lift to go by a friend to visit... he still has not washed his hands.

When I was 16, my mom knew I wasn't ready to drive so she made me wait until I was, which turned out to be 18 &amp; even then I was extremely reckless, getting into many accidents caused by my own stupidity &amp; immaturity. Now that I'm an adult, I understand y she did that &amp; I too, agree that 16 is WAY too young for children to be driving nowadays. Too much distraction we didn't have back then.  My SS recently turned 15 &amp; as soon as he became of legal age (15.5 in the state of OH) my DH ran out &amp; helped him get his permit. I understand I do not have much say on this, however I'm completely shocked he did this bc I threw my SS a bone as soon as he turned 15 &amp; let him drive down our long driveway.  I did this bc I knew my DH was soon going to let him get his license right away so I needed to see for my ownself &amp; put it to rest in my mind, if he was mature enough (not long before this, they were both having a talk about getting his license &amp; the only thing my SS said was, ""so u mean I could drive to the store to get my own Butterfinger?"" SMH. I love my SS &amp; I don't want anything bad to happen to him nor do I want him to do harm to anyone else accidentally. I just had a feeling he wasn't mentally ready. So low &amp; behold, after the 1st time I let him drive, he kept bugging me to let him do it again, bc ""he wanted to try something<span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 164, 168]'></span>."" In hindsight, I should have asked ""what?"" but I didn't think anything of it bc I never thought he was THIS immature. So the 2nd time I let him drive, while he was in the driver seat &amp; foot on the gas pedal, I notice the car drifting to the right &amp; about to hit a tree.  Now I'm thinking, any minute he's going to straighten up, of course, right?!?!!  Well, he didn't, &amp; I had to grab the wheel at the VERY last millisecond to avoid that tree.  Turns out, his focus was on trying to recline his seat &amp; drive with 1 hand bc he was wanted to ""act like a gangster."" <span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 164, 166]'></span>‍♀️ So at this point I'm thinking, of course there's no way my DH is going to let him apply for his permit. But nope. He does. Now I'm upset.  He took him &amp; he failed twice (a hint maybe???)but finally got &amp; has had for a few months.  His BM wants no part of it, won't take him nor help study for his permit or license &amp; doesn't want him driving her ""$80,000 car,"" she tells him. (it's a $30,000 '16 GMC Acadia<span class='emoji-bytes' data-emoji-bytes='[240, 159, 153, 132]'></span>) so he's been driving my DH's. The way I see it is, if his BM has excluded herself from everything &amp; anything to do with this, it's all on us now bc once he does get his license, of course he's going to want to drive, who's car is he going to drive? Ours. WHEN (not ""if"") he wrecks it, (let's face it, every new driver gets into at least 1 accident) it's going to be on us to pay &amp; deal with it all (I already know his BM won't pay half).  We have been arguing a lot about this lately.  I just wished DH would have at least asked me what I thought about it since SS's BM isn't involved &amp; it all falls on us, I would have asked him to wait a bit.  Wait until SS shows us he's bit more mature &amp; have him continue to work &amp; actually SAVE his $$ to buy his own car instead of spending all of it on video games.  I just worry that when he finally gets his license, &amp; my MIL wants to ""give"" him my recently deceased FIL'S paid off new F150 (don't get me started on that topic) if my DH let's him have this truck, how's SS going to act when he's by himself &amp; doesn't have his dad right next to him watching every move? When he has a bunch of friends in the car with him (his BM is not a very good mother so that is a very real scenario in the future) will he act responsible? Or will he try to show off, and be a ""gangster?"" The real &amp; main reason I am afflicted by this is that I genuinely do care about this kid.  I feel like my DH is not thinking clearly &amp; just bc HE got HIS license at 15, he's saying SS will be just fine like he was when he was that age.  Or maybe DH just wants to see SS more &amp; DH knows he'll come over more if he has a car.  I just don't want my SS's (or other's) life at risk bc he has a terrible mom &amp; his dad is making an emotional decision.  There's really nothing that can be done about it, my DH simply just will NOT back down from this situation &amp; thinks it's NOMB. I just need someone else who is an outsider looking in to tell me I need to stay in my lane OR that they would feel the same way as I do &amp; my DH isn't making an intelligent decision.",False,

Kid picks some Brie up, you know he won't like it, but he's never tried it... So you let him take a bit. He spits it up, no big deal. Next morning, he tries again... Do you let your kids try every day? Do you remind them that they didn't like it? Do you keep giving small pieces? Do you try every 2 months? *What do you do?*

Also, what if we're talking about Babybels or unity items (like packaged raisins, crackers, cookies, etc). Those types of things that if they don't have them, it completely goes to waste (unless you eat them!) So how do you react to those? If you know they won't eat a Babybel, do you still let them try? If not, when would you (months later?)

We are having a huge food waste problem due to them wanting to try new things we have (see different cheeses, almond milk, almond flour) but they end up not liking it but wanting to try it over and over mixed with other stuff (like almond milk with cocoa inside- why not?) and then end up not liking it. Even in small quantities sometimes it's just annoying know they are wasting but experimenting. 

That being said, I feel bad telling them not to try it. What if they *do* like it? What if almond milk with cocoa powder tastes amazing to them? What if extra strong blue cheese becomes their favorite cheese?",True,parent support
471,I took 23andme in December and my mom took one the following month. It took about 2 months for her second cousin to figure out who she was.

473,"I usually call it shepherd's pie, but my husband vehemently reminds me that shepherd's pie uses lamb, not beef...and it's really hard to find lamb out here.

So, Cottage Pie:
Ground beef
stewed tomatoes
carrots
yellow onion
chicken or beef broth (if you're a parent, it depends on whatever you have in the cupboard some nights)
flour (I have Celiac, so I either use rice flour or cornstarch)
milk or cream (whatever you have on hand)
russet potatoes
kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil

First you get a pot of potatoes going to make mashed potatoes.  Now, I have a few ways of doing this: sometimes I just put them in the steamer in my rice cooker.  Less water, less mess, takes about 20 minutes.  OR, lately I've been putting them in my pressure cooker, which takes about 10 minutes, plus I can add more potatoes to it.  Or you can just boil them on the stove.  Either way, get that going.

Then start browning the beef to almost finished with the kosher salt (don't mess around with table salt.  Use it to make homemade playdoh, but get kosher salt for cooking), pepper, basil and garlic powder.  Then add the can of stewed tomatoes, chopped onion, chopped carrots and put the lid on and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  Just to get the carrots soft.

Then take a cup of broth and heat it in the microwave for 30sec.  Then add the flour/cornstarch to it and whisk until blended.  Add this to the pot, and pour in about 1/2c of milk.  Just mix this until the liquid is bubbling and turn the stove off, but keep the pot on the burner.

Now turn your oven on to 400F and get out a deep casserole dish.  Or a casserole dish.  Or something that can go in the oven...I kind of need a kitchen make-over in this area.  So you put the meat/veg mixture into the dish, and pat it down with a spoon (don't use your fingers...it's hot.  Just saying.).  Then mash your potatoes to pretty creamy, and put that on top of the meat/veg.  

Now, if you have PAM on hand, spray the top of the potatoes.  I've tried using butter, but it doesn't coat it very evenly.  Absolutely do not use the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray.  That stuff is freaking evil.  And it doesn't work for this.

So then put it in the oven for about 15 or so minutes, or until the top of the potatoes is pretty golden.  

The great thing about this dish is that it is really versatile.  You can put whatever you want in it and mix it up.  So if you guys actually like mashed cauliflower, you could put that on top (I actually gagged when I tried mashed cauliflower, so that is never happening here).  But it's peasant food, so just use what you have.  :)",True,parent support

My parents tell me I was always quiet, even in daycare. I wouldn't talk to other kids unless they talked to me. I have several scars from being in NICU, and I remember struggling with math a lot in elementary school. I've always had a high reading comprehension score, though. I've struggled over the years with anxiety, especially agoraphobia (public speaking). I used to dread presentations, and by the end my legs and my hands would shake. 

It's gotten better in recent years, though; when I was little I couldn't even order food for myself because I was nervous, and although I do sometimes get nervous about walking up to a counter, I can push through it and do what I need to.

As far as physical problems, I have some vision issues - but it's nothing glasses can't fix. One of my vocal cords doesn't vibrate as much as the other one (I think it's because of the effect of the breathing tube in my throat while I was still growing), causing my voice to have a strange quality to it that I myself can't hear when I speak (unless I hear a recording of it). I have some hearing loss in one ear, but my other ear seems to hear well enough that it doesn't cause too many problems in my life.

Sorry I can't think of a ""TL;DR"" for this.  Also, this is a novelty account, since he's on reddit I want to keep this off my personal account.

First, and final since we last spoke, reaction was that I get an abortion.
At one point he also asked if it was his.
He said things like ""I wonder if it will be a boy or a girl"" and then he would say other things like ""this is bad timing"", "" babies are expensive"", ""I don't think I could live with myself if something was wrong with it"" (he has expressed before in past conversations how scared he is that if he had a baby it would turn out disabled in some way).
He also told me he felt dirty.
He offered to go with me for the blood test tomorrow.

Also, he knew before I told him tonight.  We sat down at the restaurant and in the first 5 minutes he asked ""are you pregnant?""

As for me I guess before hearing him say more than once about an abortion the thought didn't cross my mind.  I feel this horrible guilt anytime I do think about it.  I honestly don't know if I could mentally handle the after effects of it.  I really think that between the options of a baby ""ruining"" my life or having an abortion the latter would be the one to ruin me.  My mental health would be so far gone if I did that I would end up in a padded cell somewhere never able to forgive myself.  I am all for the option to choose but my choice is not to do it.  I think I would drink again or just have a total melt down.

I don't know if he wants this baby right now, maybe not at all.  He offered for me to sleep over tonight and I declined.

We left it at after I get the blood test results I would call him and we would talk more.  He did say this was my choice and then wrapped that up with a nice little conclusion that since I get to make the choice it's not really his kid in the long and short of it.

He asked that I not tell anyone and said he will not be telling anyone because none of this is confirmed until the whole 8 - 12 wks plus he REALLY wants me to have an abortion if I find out there is anything wrong with it at all.  Which, that would be the only time I would consider doing son.

Much more was said but those were the highlights.

So reddit, thoughts?  Any unplanned parents out there with advice?  Has anyone had an abortion who could fill me in on the mental state of life after?  I'm just lost as can be right now and I can't tell anyone I know (he knows and my one friend knows) so I have no one to talk to really.

She reminded me that it would be easier than the first time because no labor beforehand &amp; baby can come with me to recovery room. Then after she realized the circumstances of my first C-section (induced at 41 weeks, Cervadil+2 days on Pitocin, only dilated to 3, baby over 9lbs) she backtracked and mentioned going to only 40 weeks instead. This provider is my only option so there's no switching, and I am becoming less and less confident that I'll go into labor on my own. I just wanted to rant and maybe get some perspective on this because it's so early in the pregnancy and I'm already nervous. I imagine the only thing I can do is wait and see what happens (or doesn't happen) towards the end.",True,

504,"I'm 27 and my brother is 31 with special needs. Doctors couldn't figure out what exactly he has but it seems like it's some degree of autism with some type of learning disability. We both live with parents.  I currently help manage the family business with dad, keep myself available for my epileptic father, make sure my depressed mother (she's been in remission for over a year), am myself depressed and recently started medication and doing better, and am also studying for an exam to apply to medical school.

As of late my brother has been feeling very lonely. Yesterday we went to my aunt's with the family, and after I greeted our extended family I saw him crying. He refused to tell me what was wrong so I just made sure to sit at the same table with him and eat with him and didnt push it. 

My cousins went up stairs and I told my brother to come with us and we can all play games but he refused and chose to be alone.  After about 30 minutes I didnt feel good about leaving him by himself. So I went back to him, asked if he wanted to go home and open up to me and he agreed.

Once we got home he was in a crying fit like I'd never seen. He told me that he feels like everyone loves me more than they love him. I told him that it wasn't true, that any time I go to a gathering and he doesnt want to come that everyone always asks about him (which is true).  He then started crying and saying that I have friends and he doesn't (whenever my friends come over they always make sure to go to his room and see him and show him some affection, he always declines invitations to come and sit with us).

He spends the majority of his time gaming and has online friends he talks to on the daily. I put alot of blame on my parents for not being proactive when he was younger but they were stretched very thin at the time.  The past year and a half has been me neglecting myself to handle my the health of my parents but I am doing MUCH better on medication and I want to start planning more fun time together, whether that's going out to eat or having movie nights.

505,"I'm 38 weeks and ended up at the hospital last night for heavy bleeding. Things were going okay until this morning. So, I have some problems with anxiety. I am diagnosed with depression and pretty bad general anxiety disorder. 

This morning the doctor comes in to give me a cervical check and I cannot stop shaking. She starts the exam and it just hurts so much. I can't relax and the shaking got worse. So the doctor says, ""You need to work with me! Relax!"" I tried, but no matter what I do I can't relax and I can't stop shaking. 

I finished the exam, I am still shaking and start crying. Then the nurse comes in. She immediately asks, ""Have you ever been sexually abused?"" I was taken aback by how outright she was with the question and said, ""No."" Her: ""Oh, that can explain why some people get so upset at cervical checks."" 

Then she starts going on about how I need to relax and I should look up some yoga on youtube. (Because of course what with the therapists I've gone to and the medication I've taken for my anxiety, I never thought of that! /s) It felt demeaning. Like telling someone with depression to just cheer up. 

So, after that tests are done, turns out baby is fine! And I eventually get discharged and this same nurse walks me to my car.  And she starts asking these questions. ""Why are you walking so slow? Why are you walking that way?"" And I""m wondering what is wrong with the way I walk? Of course I'm slow and waddling, I'm pregnant. 

So I answer, ""Uhmm... because I'm 38 weeks pregnant and uncomfortable?""

Her: ""Oh you should do yoga and do you ever go for walks?"" Then she asks ""Why do you think you have anxiety?""

I'm thinking this isn't the time to ask me this question and it's really none of her business. So I say, ""Bad childhood."" and she just goes ""hmm.""  Then starts talking about yoga I should look up youtube again.

My wife and I have flown 5 times with our 10 month old baby girl over the past6 months, 4 times cross country (west to east coast) and once to Europe. 

The Europe trip was easy because she was only 3 months old and slept so much. It was a dream flight. 

The first few times flying cross country were also fine for the same reason. On takeoff and landing, my wife nursed her so no problems with pressure changes. During flight she slept most of the time due to lots of naps in her schedule. 

However, as she's gotten old her naps have decreased, and if she has one during the flight, the noise can startle her awake and prevent her from sleeping. The noise I'm talking about are things like people slamming overhead bin compartments, the flight attendants talking to each other or to passengers, etc. I can't expect them to care our baby is sleeping :)

So I'm looking for some advice from you all to see if you have techniques for:

1. Getting 10 month old to sleep more easily on plan at regularly scheduled nap time
2. Preventing noise like I described above from waking her 
3. Any tricks to soothe her if she cries
4. Any tricks for entertaining her

510,"I'm a mother to four identical quad boys, and all four are going to be starting the first grade in Feburary. Though this will be a relief for us, there's also a problem... the school we're putting them in only has two classes per year group. This means that we can either have two per class, three in one class and one in the other class, or have them all in one class. 


My husband and I don't know what to do. One of our sons (we'll call him 'A') is a fairly spirited kid, and he tends to fight with two of his three siblings (siblings 'B' and 'D') when they're left together. Child B is quiet and is fairly mature compared to his brothers, but A can rile him up very easily, and when they do get into a fight it's not easy to calm them down. Child D is mischievous, and he enjoys purposely provoking A and B because he finds their fighting hilarious. Child C is the only one who gets along with all three of his siblings - he's very sensitive and whenever they start fighting he usually bursts into tears.


Originally we were going to have B and C in one class and A and D in the other, but that means that unless the teacher is constantly watching them, D will have lots of opportunities to wind up his brother. I'd feel guilty as hell if we put three in one class and left one in another class on his own, because he'd be stuck alone while his brothers get to have each other. We had all four in one class for preschool, and we're not too sure if we want to repeat it (to be honest, I don't know how the teacher managed to look after all four of them and still have time to look after the other kids in the class, especially seeing as they're identical).

With my daughter I pumped 9 months and lost my supply slowly so stopping was very easy as I had nothing left. This time not so much. I currently pump 4 times a day (7am, 1pm, 7pm, 1am) and I total about 40oz a day. I'm trying to pump a little less so I'm not empty but I'm getting some painful lumps that way.

513,"I'm a stay at home mom to a 14mo little boy. He's pretty advanced with communication (says a few words, signs a few more) and a very gentle kid. Doesn't like when strangers try to make him smile but will wave and start chatting to random people if they ignore him. The typical timid/ slow to warm up type kid. He's got a very pronounced personal bubble (like his mama). 

Our issue is that in order for us to afford me staying at home I need to take kids in as a license not required day care. I'm allowed two other than my own but only take on one more at a time for now because they're still so young. One little boy (also 14mo) I watch is the mirror opposite of my guy. He's still a baby so of course he doesn't know not to take things off other kids yet or not to hit or that sometimes hugs aren't wanted and there's no need to use nails while giving a hug. He is exuberant and loving and has such a huge personality. He also doesn't sign or speak so anytime he wants anything it involves screaming. 

It's really tough for my guy to the point where he'll spend the entire day clinging to me and crying if I try to put him down (he's never been much of a crier). Throughout the day he'll wave and say ""bye"" to the other boy. I know there are lots of types of kids out in the world and I don't want to shelter mine but I can only imagine what's going on in his little head where every single toy he picks up is taken off him or if he walks any where near the other kid he gets hugged so hard he falls over with nail scratches (it's hot so mine doesn't wear clothes in the house). 

I mediate where I can. Saying things like ""C is playing with that right now, here's another toy"" or ""C doesn't feel like a hug right now, hug Hobbes (stuffy)"" Each of which are answered with screams. 

I'm sorta at a loss. Right now we've got the other boy a few days per week but starting mid August it'll only be once a week. How do you handle a spirited child with a sensitive child at the same time? Do I just stick mine in a ring sling all day and keep them somewhat separated? I'm hoping that once we start the once a week thing it'll be better. We'll also have another little girl on different days who is very similar personality wise to my guy.",False,

Near perfect apgar's, no oxygen needed... She had colic for her first four months.  Rolled over, sat up, crawled and walked all in a normal time frame.  However, she was significantly delayed in her speech.  By 18 months she still had not uttered a single word so we began speech therapy at that time.

Which brings us to now.  She is 6 years old and in first grade.  She knows her letters and the sounds that almost all of them make but she cannot string any of them together to ""read"" a word. It's almost like it hasn't clicked in her head how it works.  There are sight words that they need to learn and she is nowhere where she needs to be.  She should know 2 or 3 times more by now.  She is so far behind than her classmates.  Her teacher has had me come in to talk about how she's doing twice already.

I started going on dating apps and such to meet new people/make friends. It was hard at first getting her to let me go on my first date, but I was able to get her to allow it. 

There have been about 3 times from last year to this year where I stayed out late.  The first time I came home at around 1am and the second I came home around 2am, both times I let her know but she got very upset with me. I've been good since then coming home at a decent time and she's more accepting of me coming home at 1am. However, I started seeing someone who lives in Delaware, which is about an hour away from me (I would usually go to Philly for my other dates and friends so the distance was about the same as I'm used to) and the other night it was raining pretty badly and I didn't want to drive that far in the rain. I let her know that I was going to wait until it calmed down and she didn't reply back to me. I ended up waiting it out at his parent's place and ended up falling asleep. I left at around 4am and got home at 5, and she was livid. 

She only spoke to me through text so I texted her trying to explain things, but she still was saying how I want her to trust me, but where ever I'm going is shady. And now all today she wouldn't talk to me. It's very confusing because before when she got mad at me for it she said she didn't care if I was out all night as long as she knew I was safe, and all throughout the day when I go with my friends or guy I'm seeing I would texting her letting her know I was okay.

Idk I consider myself a good kid, I don't do drugs, smoke, or drink and since I was little I very rarely got in trouble. So, it upsets me that she thinks I'd be out doing bad things with bad people. I am more of a private person, so I guess I can see why she's suspicious. I've never told her about any of the guys I dated because they never got serious enough for me to consider that. My mom and I also have never been close and I also have trouble trusting her when I tell her things because she'll either overreact and/or go and tell other family members, so that's why I keep things from her.

I still live with her and I work part time at a daycare and am almost finished a dental assisting program, but it's hard for me to get a full time job because in the mornings when she goes to work I watch my little sister. I want to move out eventually, but I know it's not going to happen anytime soon so I'm just really stressed and have the need to be more independent, which is really impacting my mental health.

2. Should I tell her about the guy I'm seeing? I don't really want to tell her yet because it's still new and I wanted to see where it goes but I'm wondering if maybe it'd make it easier for her to let me stay out later.

I was married the first time for 5 years, with one child.  I am remarried to a woman who was also married once and has her own child.  

I am a child of a divorce, both of my parents have been remarried to their second spouses for over 30 years.  My wife's parents are still married--but her parents are both remarried.  

My wife has a half-sibling, and my child also has a half-sibling.  As you can see, we are quite the blended family!

Our co-parenting situation is pretty manageable.  We have a very good relationship with her ex, they work together very well.  My ex is completely out of the picture.  She checked out 2-3 years ago, and hasn't been back since.  My wife has been thrust into the role, involuntarily, of being full time mom.

One of our kids is a great student and outstanding athlete, and the other is borderline special needs.

We've been married now for a little over 4 years, and there are some days where we feel like we just got started blending our family.  

Today, it looks a whole lot better than it did when we first got married.  We've learned a lot along the way, and our relationship has grown stronger each time we get through another challenge.  I am grateful that both of us have committed to working through the various obstacles, instead of just blaming each other for problems and calling it quits.

Both of us are active in our church's marriage ministry, counseling other married couples.  We are also involved in the beginnings of a blended family ministry in our church as well.  We have a passion and a heart for working with couples who want to overcome the many challenges that face married couples today.

542,"I've been feeding my kid by putting a few pieces of food in front of him at a time. Early on, a pile seemed to overwhelm him so that he'd drop pieces over the side until just a few were left and then eat those, and I also have a general fear of choking. When he first started picking up and eating solids by himself, he crammed a bunch of pieces of not quite ripe avocado in his mouth in quick succession, and I ended up having to use the infant CPR ""flip him over and whack him on the back"" thing. It scared the bajeezus out of me.

Well I can't be doling meals out in handfuls forever, and he just moved up to the toddler room at daycare where they put the whole lunch in a bowl in front of each kid. I tried putting a pile of scrambled eggs and cut up grapes on a plate in front of him this morning, and he just shoveled it all in one after the other with hardly a pause. I had to take the plate away periodically, and then give it back after a few seconds, after which he'd go right back to inhaling.

558,"If you're a straight haired person parenting a curly haired child, you might have noticed that curly hair is an entirely different beast than straight hair. Hair techniques that you use on yourself, just don't work and the kiddo is left with frizz or looking like a mad scientist. Kids know when people are staring at them, and nothing causes stares like a crazy hair day. For a kid already dealing with the issues of being adopted or in foster care, this can cause more feelings of ""I don't fit in"". Luckily, there are things you can do as a parent to help.

It's ok to admit to you're out of your depth. Curly hair is tricky. Many hairdressers aren't accustomed to curls and won't always know what to do outside of washing and straightening them. [This website](https://www.devacurl.com/salon-stylist-search.html) can help you look for a stylist who is used to curls and can give you tutorials on a kids day to day hair styling.

The main takeaway I'd say for a child is never brush dry. You'll create frizz and it will most likely hurt the child's hair causing a tantrum. At bathtime, comb the tangles with a [wide-tooth comb](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Tooth-Detangle-Shampoo-Unbreakable/dp/B005NI80RY). Then add the product and air dry, towel dry with a [microfiber towel](https://www.amazon.com/Quickie-49024RM-Microfiber-Towel-24-Pack/dp/B005BGCI8K) (sorry for the amazon links, I couldn't find examples that didn't lead to a sales page) or old cotton t-shirt. Try to avoid touching the hair afterwards, that makes it frizzy. There are [special pillow cases](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-7-best-silk-pillowcases-for-curly-hair-62830) that help curly hair not get damaged and frizzy in the night. Types and amounts of product will vary based on the kids hairstyle and even the humidity of where you live. You may never get the same style two days in a row. It happens.

Right here on Reddit, /r/curlyhair can offer a lot of advice. [Naturallycurly.com](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curly-hair/curls) is also a great resource. If you can find the kids hair-type, you can look on youtube for tutorials, like ""long 3C hair, how to manage frizz"". As mentioned above, a good salon is the best place to take a kid. If the only salons in your area that are curl friendly are predominately black, and you (or even you and the kid) are white don't feel awkward in the slightest. Mention straight out you're looking for advice in taking care of the kids hair. They will be happy to help. Some salons offer a ""tutorial"" session that will be charged like another cut would be. In my experience, these are extensive and worth the money.

So to wrap it up, if you're fostering or have adopted a child with curly hair it can be easy to be overwhelmed with taking care of it. That said, there are many resources to help you learn how to manage your kids hair.",True,breastfeeding

### Calamine lotion:

It is likely that calamine lotion will become your best friend during chickenpox. This is because it is proven to help to soothe and reduce itching. This is because it contains zinc oxide which will help to soothe the skin.

This is available in both a lotion and a cream; however, the lotion might be more natural to apply, especially if the spots are hurting them. To use this effectively, you should use a clean finger or a cotton pad, and dab the lotion onto their skin. Please note though that this is not suitable for use on spots around their eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

### Honey:

Although this might sound rather odd, honey is an excellent remedy for chicken pox. This is because it has both moisturising and antibacterial properties that are great at helping to heal the blisters and soothe any soreness or itching that your child is suffering with.

To use, just apply a thin layer of honey over all of the affected areas, and leave on for fifteen minutes, or a maximum of thirty minutes, before rinsing off with lukewarm water. Do not rub.

Do remember that this might not be the most appropriate remedy for children under the age of one, as they should not have honey. If you choose to, ensure that they are supervised at all times, to ensure that they do not ingest any.",False,

574,"It's taken me almost 4 weeks to finally get time to sit at the computer with 2 free ands - time to write out the events of my son's birth!

Our Plan A was to go to the newly opened midwife-led birth centre in our city.  Plan B (if there were any complications or I wanted meds) was to go to the hospital.  There wasn't really a Plan C... ladies, make a Plan C.

It was 2 days before my due date, I'd started mat leave the week before.  I was totally expecting to go overdue, because I'm a FTM and that's what we're supposed to do, right?  At this point I had not had anything even remotely like early labour symptoms so that reinforced the idea as well.

Monday, Oct 5: I spent the day going to the bathroom a lot.  I didn't think too much of it because pregnancy makes bathroom business unpredictable.  I bounced on the exercise ball for the first time since I had blown up the day before for about 20 minutes because why not.  No idea if that 'helped'.  I wasn't planning on trying any of the ""induce your labour"" things until after my due date, but I was watching tv anyway.  

9PM: Just after we finished dinner, I started feeling menstrual cramps.  They weren't hugely strong and they didn't have defined start/finish, so I didn't think much of it.  I googled it.  My husband was assembling the high chair.  I sat on a stool and observed because the cramps were getting a bit distracting.  He knew something was up but I hadn't said anything yet.  

10PM: I told him about the weird cramps and that it might be a very early labour sign.  We chatted about video games or work or something but I couldn't help but focus on these worsening cramps.  I decided I'd try to go lie down. Our midwife had said that early labour can last a day or so, so if it's late take some gravol and tylenol to help you get some sleep - so I did that.  I went upstairs and tried to lay down.  Holy crap, that was the WORST idea ever!  Do not lie on your side when you're having contractions, apparently!  It hurt way more!  Instead, I got down on my knees beside the bed (sort of ""prayer position"") and that's when I realized there were definitely ""waves"" now.  These are contractions.  I downloaded an app and tried in vain to time them.  Cool.  Still, it could be a while, but I should probably tell my husband that I'm probably in labour.  

11PM: I went down and explained the situation and he went into ""support mode"".  He went upstairs with me and we made sure we had the last of our hospital bag stuff packed, clothes and snacks and such.  The pains were getting worse and he suggested running a warm bath - BEST idea ever!  I hopped into the tub and it really made things not feel so bad.  He sat beside the tub and made sure I stayed hydrated.  At this point he had grabbed a watch to time contractions (he tried to be subtle about it to not worry me) and they were all over the place.  He suggested maybe I try sleeping again.  I got out of the tub and had one awful contraction which caused me to puke and immediately back into the bath I went.  (Sidenote, one of our cats jumped into the tub in the meantime and my husband had to chase him down and try to dry him off.  Some bonus labour LOLs.)

12AM: We were waiting for the magical ""4-1-1"" but they seemed to come anywhere from every 10 minutes to every 2 minutes and some were 45 seconds and some were 10 and the intensity was anywhere from ""I can talk through this one"" to ""UNNNGGGGHHHHHH"".  After each bad one I mentally told myself ""2 more, then we'll call the midwife.""  I kept pushing it back and back.

2AM:  I am not sure where the time went.  I sat in the tub and just managed.  I ate a granola bar or something. I drank some water.  Finally I told my husband it's time to make the call.  The midwife asked if I wanted her to meet me at the birth centre or if she should come to the house to assess first.  I hadn't said anything, but at this point my mind had sort of decided I wasn't leaving the house.  I did not want to spend half an hour in the car having contractions!  So I had the midwife come to our house first.  We also called my mom and DH's mom and texted my brother - they are all out of town but we wanted to let them know this was really happening!

2:30AM: Midwife arrives and makes me move from the comfort of the tub to the bed to do my first ever cervical check.  I joked with my husband that I'm probably like 2cm dilated and I'm just a wuss.  Nope... 8cm, almost 9cm already.  WHAT.  That's like, most of the way there!  ""Well, guess we're having this baby here."" I said, matter-of-factly.  We hadn't really prepared for this.  (Like I said.. have a plan C!)  Luckily, my husband is quick on his feet and found a thick plastic mattress bag from our recent move to cover the floor with, and some old towels we could sacrifice if needed, and set up a tall laundry basket with a garbage bag in it for all the trash.  There was no getting back in the tub at this point.  I got back into the ""prayer position"" which was by far the most comfortable and the way I stayed the rest of the labour.  Husband sat on the bed and held my hand.

Another cat anecdote: One of our cats has a very motherly instinct.  During many contractions she was there purring at me and nuzzling back and forth below my chest.  Whenever my husband left my side to help the midwife, the cat literally took his place.

I was generally lucid and able to converse between contractions.  I kept asking the midwife what I was supposed to be doing, when should I push, etc.  She said when I feel like I need to poop, and she checked again - she wanted me to wait a bit longer because I wasn't quite fully dilated.  I waited as long as I could until I remember screaming out ""I can't NOT push any more!!"" and so she gave me the go ahead.

3:30AM: I know some people like the pushing part, and I did appreciate being able to ""feel"" the progress... but I didn't really like it.  It hurt and it just felt weird.  Like I was constipated with the biggest poo ever.  I could feel his head in my ""birth canal"" and kept picturing all the diagrams from all the labour books, etc. of the head progressing.

POP!  There goes my water.  At this point I couldn't really talk between contractions because I needed the breather between pushes.  I just wanted him to get the F out of my stupid birth canal.  

4:01AM: They told me when the head was out, and one good push after and I felt the whole thing slip out (again, it was really reminiscent of a big hard poo). 

My first reaction:  ""HOLY CRAP, that's a real actual BABY.  That thing was inside me.  Crazy!""

They laid me back down on the floor (in my giant puddle of bloody wet grossness, but who cares, I was naked).  They propped me up with some pillows, and plopped a baby on my chest.  It was pretty darn cool.

A few minutes passed and we realized no one actually checked if it was a boy or girl.  A quick peek and ""Uh, definitely a boy!"" says my husband. (8lbs 7oz, 21"")

I did end up with some tearing and stitches.  2nd degree perineum (5 or so stitches) and 1st degree labial (no stitches).  Super annoying for like a week after the birth.

Tips!

- Have stuff just in case you end up giving birth at home.  You really don't need much, but a large plastic tarp or mattress bag is cheap and makes for easy cleanup!
- Don't put too much stock in the ""4-1-1""/""5-1-1"" rule.  Contractions don't use watches.  Maybe play it on the safe side if they are being inconsistent for you.
- Keep thinking about the fact that each contraction only lasts a matter of seconds and then you'll get a break.  (Do not think about the fact that the breaks ALSO only last a matter of seconds!)",False,

579,"I’ll preface this by saying I know we are only three days in, so I’m not expecting perfection. 

My son (34 months) is on day three of potty training. We’re doing “cold turkey”, no diapers except at bedtime. 

Day one: nothing but accidents. He peed EVERYWHERE. If we got him to sit on the potty AT ALL it was a huge victory. He stayed dry through a two hour nap though, so we know at least his bladder has a pretty good capacity. 

Day two: Rough morning, but willing to sit on the potty. Dry through nap time then, eureka! After his nap he started shouting “I need to poop!” and running to the toilet. (Side note, pooping usually takes several tries throughout the day for him, so I think that he was actually identifying a need to poop, then only peeing). No accidents for the rest of the day!

Day three (today): Back to HATING the idea of even sitting on the potty. Refused all morning. Dry through nap time, but almost didn’t make it to the potty because he refused to use it (he hid in the closet and kept telling me no). Now he’ll voluntarily use the potty, but the entire afternoon/evening he’ll shout “I had an accident!” then run to the potty and finish the last few drops there. 

I appreciate that he’s identifying his accidents and trying to get to the toilet, but we haven’t had any real successes today. And, I don’t know how to treat prizes when this happens. I don’t want to reward an accident, but I do want to praise him for trying to get to the potty. I also don’t want him to feel defeated because he is trying.

I’m always a little concerned about his development because he is nonverbal, not potty trained (working on it), and he will not eat food unless it is baby food consistency.  He was eating solids around age 2 or 3, until he had tubes put in, due to ear infections.  After that, he refused solids.  He also refuses to feed himself at home.  His mom works a lot and doesn’t have the energy to work with him on this stuff every day.  So I’m curious if any of you had issues similar, and what you would suggest?

584,"I’m a first time mom (18f) and I have a 17 month old son. He is so bad I don’t know how to handle it. 

Sorry this will be lengthy. 

I never wanted kids, but I always knew if I had any (by accident etc) I would never lay my hands on them or raise my voice. However, I find myself frequently raising my voice. I know this does nothing, I was verbally abused and beaten with belts, paddles, or whatever was nearby until I was about 14, so I never want my child to affiliate those kinds of things with their parents or even practice the same behaviors when they are a parent. 

My mother claims my son is worse than my older sister was as a toddler. My mother actually saw a priest to ask for advice and got my sister baptized multiple times because she truly thought there was something wrong with her. My mom says my son is 10x worse than my sister was. 

He has been very vocal and not very affectionate since he was around 6 mos. He never wants to cuddle or sit down with me, and when I talk to him he usually walks away or makes noise to drown me out. It’s heartbreaking. He is really the only person I have and it seems like he does not love me. 
He’s such a happy guy and he’s very excitable, it hurts me to tell him anything because I don’t want to kill his spirit. 

It is extremely stressful. I constantly have my hands full and his behavior makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong. I barely use my phone around him, I try to read to him and play cars with him, I always eat meals with him, I take him to the park nearby, I let him watch cartoons whenever he brings me the remote, etc. 
I’m a full time student (18hrs), I’m the only adult in the house (it’s just me and him), and I live an hour away from my family. My mother is also going through a lot in her marriage currently so I can’t rely on her for help. 


I truly do not know what to do. Any and all advice for extremely rambunctious toddlers will be GREATLY appreciated. 



Some examples of my sons behavior:

-When trying to read to him : screams until I stop talking, takes the books out of my hands and closes them, throws the books, rips pages out of the books 
-Pulls every single book off the shelf and dumps out the entire toy basket without playing with anything or trying to look at books 
-throws food on the floor and at the walls if he doesn’t like what i’ve given him to eat 
-asks for one of those little squeeze pouches of baby food, then once he has it he squeezes it onto the furniture and wipes it around 
-takes the cup in the tub and pours water outside of the tub 
-takes my makeup out and hides it around the house (under the couch, behind the toilet, under the fridge, in my shoes) 
-asks for a snack then dumps it out and stomps it into the carpet 
-takes his bottles and turns them upside down and drops them on the floor 
-takes anything hard and easy to hold and bangs it against the walls or floors to make noise 
-rips off pieces of drywall (old apartment) 
-slashes at the blinds until they are all messed up or until he has a piece of them 
-takes his diaper from underneath him while I’m changing him and throws it off the changing table 
-screams pretty much any time I change his diaper or clothes 
-CLIMBS EVERYTHING. He just climbed a chair a few days ago, my boyfriend and I took him off the chair, I kid you not, 10-15 times, and the last time he got on the chair it fell backward and he busted his upper and lower lip. 



These may seem like normal curious behaviors, but I deal with at least 5 of these in one day, multiple times a day. He understands what “No” means because occasionally he will stop when I tell him “No” or “stop”.  Usually when I tell him though, he looks at me, smile, and continues what he’s doing. 

I really want to improve his behavior because he is constantly being rough and jumping off of things and climbing things and getting hurt, and I don’t want people to think I am hurting him. Is there any way to calm him down? I don’t want him to suffer any long term damage.

594,"I’m tired of random strangers chatizing me for doing my job as a parent. Everyday I get discriminated against by random people of how because I parent my kids. Does anyone else have this problem. Like how do you resolve these issues?

For example, two nights ago my wife and I took our 3 kids to Olive Garden. Some background, our youngest, Jacsin, is 7 years old. We decided to continue breastfeeding him till he’s 8, as well as diapering him. It’s just too difficult to potty train and much healthier to breast feed. I did the same for the older two kids.

Anyways, while we were dining. Jacsin did a big poop in his diaper. After 10 minutes of him screaming about his butt being mushy, the poop started to stink really bad. I realized I had to change it. However, the bathroom was too far from the table. Honestly, the restaurant should have bathroom closer to our table. My wife and I have talked about suing the restaurant because of this. 

I couldn’t change Jacsin at our table, because we didn’t want to mess up our food. So, plan C it was. I approached the neighboring table of two dining couples. I said excuse me and plopped Jacsin on table, accidentally knocking over a few glasses. 

I proceeded to change Jacsin’s diaper and accidentally spilled some creamy clumps of poop into the customers pasta dishes. Instead of being understanding of my dilema, the couples started to scream. I hushed them and told them to be more compassionate. Suddenly, Jacsin, with diaper down, started squirting and spewing diarrhea all over the couples’ , their food and their table. All of them got it in their mouths. 


They immediately called for the manager while I quickly sat Jacsin back down at our table. Once the manager approached us, he told us to leave the restaurant. I told him no, this is a restaurant and families are welcome too. I was so angry that I threatened to never come back.

 Luckily, the manager let us stay. He ended up kicking couples out because he didn’t want to loose our business. Honestly, I was so mad at the couples I tipped 18 cents on a $75 meal.

Fuck those customers. They’re just another example of people mistreating us because we’re parents. I just wanted to see if any other parents have similar problems. I am interested in discussing some solutions.",False,
595,"I’ve (20F)  never talked about this to anyone besides my ex and even then I didn’t get too into it because I don’t like thinking about it. Its been bothering me a little bit lately and I wanted get an outside looking in opinion. There’s A LOT of detail and I’ll try to organize it as best as I can but TLDR; at the bottom. 

My mom and dad were never married. As long as I can remember my parents didn’t like each other. I really only know my dads half of the story about why my parents weren’t together so know that most of what I’m saying is what I’ve been told by my dad, grandma and step mom. When I was a month old my mom left me because “she didn’t want me”. I’ve always thought this was weird because I have 2 older brothers from my mom and she was still in their life, I think? My dad says she left to California one day, we were living in Las Vegas, and my dad saw the opportunity to get a lawyer and get full custody of me ASAP. My grandma drove from California that same day and we lived in a hotel room for awhile. I’ve seen pictures from this time where I was sleeping in the drawer of the hotel room. I think it’s worth mentioning that my mom has some serious mental issues. From her end she didn’t tel me the specifics other than “mommy needs to take a lot of pills everyday to be okay”. My brothers would tell me how before pills that she was so angry all the time and super erratic. From my understanding my mom is a depressed bipolar schizophrenic. My mom apparently freaked out when she heard and came back and threatened to fight to get me back but when the court day came she gave in and let my dad take me. She got visitation rights but I don’t think it was 50/50. I remember my dad meeting my step mom when I was 2 and I had a lot of issues being with her throughout my entire life, but I currently have an alright relationship now. Around the same time my mom met my step dad, he was really cool and I miss him. When I was 3 both my parents married, but my mom moved to New Jersey because that’s where my step dad lived and worked. After this I only saw my mom when I had breaks from school. I essentially only saw my mom over the summer for one month out of the year. During these times I went out there and also hung out with my two older brothers. I only saw them a couple times a year. When my oldest brother turned 18, I was 10,  he left my moms house, he was the only one that lived there full time, moved to California I didn’t see him as often and I haven’t talked to him since I was 17. When I was 14 my 2nd older brother turned 18 he also stop coming out to visit my mom. I spent 2 summers alone with my mom and then I completely cut her out of my life. 

The first summer I spent alone with my mom was the worst. Nothing that she did though, all me, I got caught sending nudes to a girl and I was forced to come out as gay. It was awful, but my mom was more mad that I was sending nude to strangers at 14 rather than me being gay. I honestly don’t remember if she told my dad or not. I think my step mom caught me soon after I got back and I was forced to come out as gay again. This time tho they were mad about both, more so that I was gay tho. They called me disgusting and put me in church classes. The next summer with my mom I don’t remember too much. I remember just being on my moms phone 24/7. At my dads house I wasn’t allowed to have one and when I had access to my moms I took it to talk to my friends. When I got back my mom called me every fucking day. It was so annoying and time consuming because she just called and wanted to talk forever but I had things to do. I was busy trying to live my life and I told her that she can only call me 3 times a week. She agreed to it but called me like 5 times. It irritated me that she wasn’t listening to what I asking of her.  I told her she can only call me once a week from now on. She called me 3 days in a row. On the last day she called me twice, I forget what it was about but when I brought up her calling me again she got mad and said “well if (step mom names) would pass along my texts to her and stop being a bitch I wouldn’t have to call you again”. I didn’t get along with step mom at all. We would fight every day. Screaming, yelling, lying, I hated her. When my mom called her a bitch tho I got so mad at her. I don’t even know why. I hung up on my mom and ignored her calls for a week. I took one phone call of her after my dad forced me too but fought and I haven’t taken a phone call of hers since. My dad and step mom always asked why I wouldn’t talk to her. I just told them that I hated her and she was a bad mom and she’s crazy. 

I honestly to this day don’t know the real reason why I don’t talk to her. I feel like it’s some deep thing inside me that I just can’t think of but has to be there for me to feel strongly about this. That’s mainly why I’m posting on reddit to see if someone out there can see the answer that I just don’t. I’m too afraid/bust to go to therapy at this point in my life. 

One time my step mom invited over my mom and 2nd older brother over after a couple months of me going no contact. I refused to even see her. I locked myself in the bathroom for 30 minutes while my step mom was thinking of every punishment she could think of to get me to go talk to her. I eventually sat in the room with her. I didn’t say anything but I listened. While my mom was talking she pushed my hair behind my ear and I told her “don’t fucking touch me” and stood up and started screaming at her. My brother tried to calm me down but I just walked away from her and the situation as a whole. She literally chased me around the house and I was slamming doors in her face. I walked out the front door and my mom tackled me. My brother put me in some wrestling move hold. I later learned that because I had a history of saying suicidal things they thought I was going to jump in the middle of the road. This is fucking crazy to me because I lived in the middle of the country. We barley had cars drive by. My brother took me into a room just me and him and kept asking why I don’t want to talk to her. I gave the same reasons as I gave my parents and told him she was annoying, bad mom, I hated her. He was the only kid that still talked to her. My oldest brother stopped talking to her a few years after he moved out. There was a lot of pressure on my 2nd bother to try and fix things and I honestly feel bad I put him in that position. 
 

The first day of my junior year changed everything. I still didn’t have any access to electronics. I was still being forced to go to church classes but I was secretly dating this girl from school. I went a full year of stealing one of my younger siblings devices and hiding them around the house. Tablets, old iPhones, my DSi actually got internet and I was texting my gf of Twitter from there. First day of junior year I get caught. My younger sister saw me out something on a high shelf, went to look and found an iPod and went straight to tell my dad and step mom. We had an awful fight. 2 days later the tension was at an all time high and my step mom told me if I disrespect her again that she was going to slap me. I was 16 at the time and way too old to be getting hit by parents. I told her if she slaps me I’m going to slap her back. She gasped and cried. I was walking through the house later that night when I heard her telling my dad a twisted version of the story and telling him to “be a man”. I ran to me and my 3 other sisters rooms and was sitting in my bed, my sister in her bed,  when my dad came in and went to me closet and started tearing my closet apart, throwing my stuff around, he was yelling at me and lifted my dresser holding our tv and threw it completely breaking it. We were yelling at each other when he pushed me, I fell and tried to hit him and he got on top of me and started slapping me. My younger sister grabbed a bat and told us to stop but he grabbed it out fo her hands so fast that she ran out of the room he hit me a few more times while sitting on my chest when my step mom came it. I was begging her to tell him to stop but she just told me, while holding my 2 year old brother at the time, “you deserve this”. I got back on my feet but my dad pushed me again. I twisted my ankle but he called me an over dramatic dyke. To stop acting like my mother. I went to leave through the door but my dad pushed me and I hit the wall behind me and broke through the dry wall. He said later that he thought I was going to hurt my step mom. I wasn’t. Pretty sure they still don’t believe me to this day. I cried on the floor and they left. My dad came back later and ripped apart my bed and found my diary. He told me he should have let my mom abort me. I didn’t sleep that night and later went onto my 2nd hidden device to tell my gf what just happened. The next day at school I had some light bruises on my face. Enough that a few people noticed. This one girl who I hate to this day laughed in front the entire girls locker room after seeing my face and hand shaped bruises on my back and arms and said “oh what did your daddy beat you”. I told the school counselor after my gf forced me to. I ended up in foster care. My oldest brother took me in for awhile until he decided that me getting a B+ in calculus was unacceptable. Haven’t talked to him since. My mom flew over to see me when She heard what happened. I think she wanted to get custody of me, leave my step dad and buy a house here. I didn’t want to see her at all, but the social workers told me I HAD to. When she saw me she brought me Taco Bell and tried to talk to me. I ignored every word. Eventually started crying and yelling at her. She also went to my court hearing once. Both my parents made complete fools of themselves there. My dad acting like he owned the room, but getting shut down by everyone and my mom acting like the crazy lady. 

I didn’t talk to my dad again until last November. I feel like crap all the time because I wasn’t apart of my 8 younger siblings lives anymore. I saw them once a year. I hadn’t really hung out with them without wine social worker around since the night before. Even then they only probably remember the horrible person I was then. I wasn’t to make thing right so for my dads birthday I sent him a card saying I want to try to have a relationship again. It took awhile to be comfortable again, but I try to go over to see my siblings and I can actually be around my parents and get past what happened. My dad helped me by driving me down to San Diego when I wanted to buy a car but needed a ride. Things with there are basically getting better and part of me is happy with that.

With my mom tho is another side. Over the years she has tried to reach out to me. Every attempt is met with me insulting her and telling her I hate her and wanting zero contact. I haven’t heard from her in awhile and for he more part I’m okay with that. There is a new voice in my head tho asking me why tho. Why could I get over the horrible situation with my dads side but I’m okay with never speaking to my mom again? I think it’s weird. Looking back I said a lot of horrible shit to her that I regret but even past that I don’t want to try and have a relationship with her again. Part of me is afraid of regretting it when she dies but I honestly think I could get over it after a  week or two. Over the summer I got an email from my stepdad, who I hadn’t talked to since I was 15 telling me I should talk to my mom and that my dad won and got what he wanted. I told him I’m sorry but I can’t and I didn’t hear back. 

I hear all the horrible things my mom did when I was younger and add it too how she acted and for some reason in my head that’s justified not to talk to her anymore. I always remember my mom just making me uncomfortable. She would tell me things as a kid like “my hair stylist is a black some, please don’t mention it when we’re there” “I used to work a very dirty job and that’s why I had to move to New Jersey”. She would often talk bad about my dad or make jokes about how she didn’t like him. She would sleep a lot because of her meds and when she was on them she would just act weird. Like not get social cues very well or just over think things. Is he also had a bad temper even with the meds. When I was 6 I hid my moms cigarettes and she shook me and screamed at me until I showed her I hid them under my bed. I guess had certain  issues and allergies when I was growing up with my lady parts. I remember my mom yelling at me when she saw blood I’m in my underwear. She took me to the hospital and the doctors for a few days thought I was being sexually abused. I remember being put under at a hospital back home and after that I couldn’t take bubble baths. I never really knew why. She would bring Thai up when I was 12-13 when my brothers were around and I fucking hated it. I acted like I didn’t remember anything thinking she would stop talking about it and instead she paused the movie the entire family was watching to question me about it. She would ask me if my younger sisters had started puberty yet, like wtf idk. She thought buying me things would buy my love and acting like she was a friend more than a mom.

614,"Let me just start by saying I really love everybody involved in this situation so this is just me venting my spleen for a second. 

My MIL brought my BIL and my 12 year old step son to visit over the past weekend. They live several states away (12+ hour drive) and so she doesn’t get to see my almost 5 month old son except over FaceTime. The last time she saw him in person was when we brought him home from the hospital. My step son came and stayed with us for a month and a half right after that, which was very stressful because my son was 2 weeks old with colic and he’s my first. So I was REALLY trying to figure things out. Pair all that with the fact that my step son has been an only child for 12 years and he had somewhat of a hard time adjusting. He’s an amazing big brother, and he loves his little brother fiercely, but he gave his father a pretty hard time at times. This seems to have *mostly* gone away, he is more back to his old self now. He still has bratty moments though, mostly aimed at my husband. But he also is still learning about babies and crying back in my baby’s face when he cries doesn’t help. So I’ve had to be really firm about boundaries with him and the baby while also trying not to overstep because he isn’t my child. 

My husband and I were super excited to see his family and went grocery shopping so I could cook all our meals (ribs, chicken, steak) since I have some dietary restrictions and it’s easier to cook than try to load the baby up and go out.  I’m gluten light (not free I still eat some but when I do I’m just prepared for a backlash), because I have a gastrointestinal issue that is exacerbated by gluten. I got up early and cooked all this food yesterday. I even pumped my milk and gave the baby bottles in his carrier so I could get everything prepped and ready for the oven and grill. They barely touched it. They did eat all the snacks I had in the cabinet though, including the two large dark chocolate bars with pistachios I had hidden as my Friday treats along with a small glass of wine (which also has gluten so I have to carefully measure each glass I drink). I had a gluten free pizza in the fridge with four pieces left that I was going to heat up and eat real quick because I’m breast feeding so I get SUPER ravenous and the box is still in there. The pizza is gone though. And my bottle of wine is also gone. 

I currently have a roast in the crock pot. I’m pretty much making it for myself because I don’t figure they’ll eat it. All my gluten free snacks are completely gone, and I have at least three pounds of ribs sitting in the fridge untouched. 

The other problem is that the baby refuses to nap when they’re here. My husband and I are quiet people, we rarely have the tv on and he rarely plays video games. They keep the tv on 24/7 even if they don’t watch it and I’m constantly turning it down or off so the baby can sleep. They want to pass him around and he gets very overwhelmed and cries but when I take him they say I should just let him cry and I’m spoiling him. I definitely ignore all that because if I’m holding him and he’s not crying, then clearly the problem is that he doesn’t want to be held by somebody else. But by the time we got to 7:30pm last night he was borderline hysterical from being overwhelmed and overtired. I finally just took him and walked into our bedroom and closed the door. He cried himself to sleep after a long while, while I just walked and rocked him. I’m trying to be a good hostess and daughter in law, because truly they are wonderful in laws and I know I’m sensitive and emotional (thanks postpartum anxiety!) but I’m also tired and a little hurt now. 

Anyway I REALLY needed to vent that. And whew I feel better now.",False,

619,"Looking for some reassurance here. 

My 16 month old son cannot say a word, nor does he respond to any words. He doesn't even seem to know his name.

On his pediatrician's advice we've had him evaluated by the state child development services. They graded him on a number of different scales, and he was around average for everything (fine motor skills, problem solving, etc) except for Communication Skills, where he had the lowest possible grade. They did tell us that they had zero concerns about autism, because his eyes and body language proved him to be very engaged and responsive. So he's good at everything except this one thing, the recognition and use of words.

Next step is a hearing test, but to us his hearing seems to be fine. He responds to familiar speaking tones and cadences (eg scolding, or ""where's baby?"" games) appropriately. But the actual words don't mean anything to him, from what we can tell.

He can make a ""meow"" sound and a ""roar"" sound. So that's something. He babbles.

The CDS has recommended early intervention. This doesn't seem to be a very intensive course of action ... mostly just training us, the parents, on how best to engage with and encourage him. Maybe some baby sign language. Nothing too ambitious. Mostly just keep at it and hope for the best.

620,"Looking for some wisdom.
School starts tomorrow and my son has the teacher we desperately didnt want. 
Last year she had my daughter(yr6) for Math and in the mid year reports she got a 2 grades for Math -an A and a D. It was such a huge difference that i queried it (if our kids ever drop below a c we need to be able to help them pick up concepts they missed and i told her so)  and she shrugged me off saying it was a confidence thing, literally walking away... Now my kid has oodles of confidence and if you knew her you'd know that simply couldn't be it. I called my husband and told him what happened because i was upset and he rang the school for further explanation. It ended up being changed to a B with the reason being apparently grading was done and locked in before they learned the material.
 Since then this woman has refused to return a greeting even when i have been in the classroom alone with her and there is no way she has missed it. I just left it at the time because she wasnt the main teacher i had to deal with and daughter said she was fine to her.
But i know she has also ignored a former student who returned to help with a performance so i know Im not the only person she treats like this. And i have heard that she was quite mean last year to a few yr 6 students (but now she has moved to yr 4s) 
I often have to keep my sons teacher informed about his current asthma/eczema situation and i am dreading having to interact with this woman. Also he is a sensitive kid and im not sure he has the resilience to handle her if what my daughter told me is true.

I am unsure whether i should address my concern off the bat and if so with whom, or do i wait and see and hope for the best. Do i try to get his class switched?

626,"Me and my son are going to alton towers at the end of the month, on a coach trip which has already been paid for. 
I'm trying to get a ride access pass for him so we can skip some of the queues. 
Alton towers said they need a letter from gp with diagnosis plus stating WHY my son is unable to queue. So I call the docs and they tell me it's £25 for a doctor's letter and that I had to write out what I wanted the doc to put. I asked if my son needed to be seen for this and they said no.
So I took the letter in yesterday, paid, and the receptionist read through the letter (with my permission) and said everything was OK.

Cut to just now, I just got a call from the docs saying they can only put his diagnosis in the letter and nothing about the reasoning as to why he's unable to queue. I asked why and she said cos he hasn't been seen by the doctor in a while, so I said well I asked if he needed to be seen and was told no. I also asked how they'd even be able to tell from a quick 10 min appointment in a completely different setting to a theme park ride queue and she said she 'couldn't really comment on that sorry'.
So my only options now are to try and get on the triage appointment list first thing in the morning and try to go in and have him seen and to sort it out, or not go and get a refund from the doc and for the alton towers tickets (if I even can.)

631,"My (25F) SO (33M) had a revised mediation with BM (33F), instigated by us as he forgot to clarify last time that our home would be considered SK’s main residence - surprisingly this went down without as fight, but I don’t think BM realises this means that when SKs move to the next stage of school they will remain in our district. 

My first question is, my SO is reluctant to put in a formal court application for main residence as he feels this will get BM’s back up (despite her agreeing to it in mediation). However, I feel he should do it because this will come back to bite us in a couple of years when she realises what the main residence actually means. In short, should I leave it and deal with issue when it arises or should I talk to my SO about putting in the CO, which will be simple as we just send in the mediation notes signed by both. My view point on this is prevention is better that cure.

Second point, that I’m not sure how to handle is...during the mediation BM mentioned that she feels “threatened” by me as I’m doing things that she thinks should be reserved for her as the boys mum. I’ll be the first to say that I have been, only because when I came on the scene these things weren’t being done at all. For example, she never went to parents evenings, so I joined my SO on them built up a rapport with the teachers so now, if there is any trouble they just contact my SO and I directly. My SO then relays the message to BM, it seems that she’s upset because she only knows after the fact, which I understand but BM also shouted at one of the teachers in the playground, so it’s understandable that she now feels awkward about speaking to them and visa versa. 

She mentioned other things about feeling upset that I organised the school fair, which didn’t really sit well with me as she’s in the same parent group chat that I am, so she had the same opportunity to get involved as I did. IMO the problem is that these are not her ideas, that someone else (i.e me) doing them and the thought didn’t even cross her mind so she’s in her feelings about it.

Part of me feels like her being threatened by me is not my problem and I don’t think my SO and I should stop doing things for the SK because of this, as we both know/feel these are not things she would even do - it’s coming across as “if I’m not doing it I don’t want anyone else to”.

For example we’re planning this Halloween party for the SKs (7&amp;8) and how do we navigate telling her this as it seems that her motherhood is very fragile. IMO we shouldn’t have to tip toe around doing things in our life because of her feelings, she’s loves playing the victim and will take offence in anything that we do. Even if we tell her and invite, I have no doubt she will still feel very like someone is taking her “role”.

Daycare is not on board so it is taking longer than I had hoped but we do have a lot of success and I would call him potty trained but not potty independent. He only wears diapers at daycare and nighttime (goes to school in undies, is changed in to undies immediately when we get home). He does pretty good and tells us when he needs to go. Sometimes he tells us a little too late but in general we are accident free during the week and have even had full day success on weekends.

He definitely doesn't stay dry over night so I'm not really looking to night train yet. The problem lately is when we put him to bed he will then say ""pee pee"" ""poo poo"" ""caca"" which is what he says when he has to go. Sometimes it will be right after he's gone so I know he doesn't really need to. This usually happens 2-5 times before he falls asleep and I will get him up and let him try to use the potty each time. I think he is using it as an excuse to delay bedtime. At the same time, sometimes he does go and I don't want to discourage him from listening to his body and letting us know. A couple times when I haven't listened and told him enough is enough and it's time for sleep (usually around time 4 or 5) he has peed himself and then gotten really upset.

He has started peeing and pooping on himself and only when he's with me. 

The first two days I figured he was just having accidents because he was busy all day running around with his grandma who watches him. I had him change and didn't make a big deal about it, other than to say he's a big boy now who uses the potty.

Yesterday was the third day. He was playing outside and did it again. I said we would have to go inside and change. He said he was fine with playing outside in his pee pants so I let him walk around like a cowboy for 20 minutes. When we got inside he was so stinky he had to take a bath, which he hates. Get him in new underpants and he does it again. This time, I take off his underwear and tell him we're back in nudey butt til he uses the potty again... He said he liked being a baby and wanted to eat baby food and wear diapers. I said, ok and ate some of his m&amp;m (potty treats) in front of him and gave him some of that nasty baby oatmeal.

He usually poops first thing in the morning while he's still wearing his pull up (which he has always slept in) and then will poop in his underwear during the day, often right after we've put him in bed for nap, but it can happen any time. Because he's going 2x a day I know he's not constipated. He also doesn't seem to be afraid of the toilet.

I have gotten frustrated and yelled, and I have threatened punishment (actually threw out 2 of his toy cars) but clearly it hasn't worked.

648,"My 4wo DD started off eating Similac Pro-Advance that my husband stocked up on before I gave birth, and had no problems except for gassiness, which lead us to try Similac Sensitive.

WIC gave us Gerber Soothe. Immediately after starting her on that, she starts to sleep heavily ... is increasingly lethargic... we have to wake her for every feeding. Every. Feeding. And we have to continue to wake her up through the feedings.  This girl who was eating between 3-4oz every 3 hours was barely breaking 1.5oz per feeding. She was latching poorly, seemingly unable to will up the energy to maintain a good latch.

Our doctor said she might be intolerant and to switch her back. We had run out of Similac Sensitive but still had a container of Pro-Advance. 

She took to it like she'd been starved. Back to normal by her second feeding, after which she projectile vomited ... but after that, and for the past 4 days, she has been doing just fine and is back to herself.

She is also very needy when it comes to physical affection. She is almost 5 and is just now starting to sleep on her own. It has been a very difficult process and she still wants/needs to be cuddled to sleep every night. She also demands a lot of snuggle time throughout the day and night. Not only is it often inconvenient or impossible for someone to cuddle with her the second she asks for it, it worries me both that she is reliant on the physical contact which will not always be available to her (she starts kindergarten in the fall) and that she is not respectful of other people's bodies.

Also, getting her to bed has been hellish too. We do her normal routine then she wails for an hour so we reset and try again after some light play. It can't take 2 hours to put her down every night.

He cannot walk anymore, has some sort of dementia, frequent incontinence and vocal outbursts(although generally very docile). 

Ok, so my mother lives in a 2 story townhouse. She owns it, but it's not in a great neighborhood, and could only get ~25 grand for it due to location.  The inside is actually quite nice.  It's not a bad neighborhood, but it is one in decline.  That is not so much the issue, but there is only 1/2 a bath downstairs, under the stairs.  Since Micheal stays downstairs, it's a real issue.  It's also built on a slab so it would be tremendously expensive to converting the 1/2 bathroom to something that could be used to bath a handicapped person. The path to the car has 4 steps as well, and is not handicapped accessible either.  
My mother has been looking around for a year for houses.  
My question is this:  Does anyone know of any federal/state (South Carolina) programs that will assist my mother in the purchase of a house to better take care of Micheal?

676,"My daughter is 12 mo now, wow did that ever go by fast. We were bed sharing but it wasn’t working out so great as we would be waking her if we would move around in our sleep. I swear every little noise was waking her up. We had to tip toe in and ever so quietly to get into the bed and then one little brush against something and she would start moving about. We decided to move her to her own (crib) mattress but had it set up on the floor next to ours. That worked for a couple weeks but she was still waking up if she heard us making the tiniest bit of noise; I figured maybe she was ready for her crib in her own room. I was nervous to try but if she would sleep better it would be worth a try. So we brought all of her things she needed to sleep and transferred them into her bedroom and like magic, she was falling asleep quicker and staying asleep longer; my husband was even able to put her to sleep without any fuss. It has been a month since crib transition however it wasn’t a full transition. At the end of the night/early morning, around 4-5am, I bring her in the bedroom and she will sleep for another 2 hours. I don’t know if this is confusing for her or if it’s just because we are in another leap but as soon as she’s next to me in bed, feed feed feed, wake wake wake. I know she (and I) will have a better sleep if she is in her crib but I don’t feel comfortable if it feels forced. If she won’t settle in my arms while I’m rocking her on the boob, she definitely won’t want to go back in the crib. 

Is it confusing to be going back and forth from crib to bed? I know consistency is important, she was consistently sleeping until 4-5 in crib and then nursing/cuddling in bed until it was time to wake up. But now she is waking up earlier and earlier. There are only 3 more days left of the leap, I’m wondering if those 3 days will really make a difference once they are over. I read it could be molars? I don’t see or feel any in there. I do see more bottom teeth, I think. She’s not a fan of my poking around in her mouth. I’m just so freakin’ exhausted. I lose the ability to tell myself it will pass when I am this tired.

Any advice/experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks mamas!",True,
677,"My daughter is 2 months old. She went through a growth spurt at around 4 or 5 weeks where she would never let me put her down and nursed all day long. Ever since that growth spurt, she won’t even sleep with my husband like she used to. Even if I can successfully put her in her bassinet asleep, so far the longest she stayed asleep for was half an hour. When she’s awake, she just wants to nurse. She only seems to fall asleep from nursing. And throughout the day it’s just tiny cat naps. Nurses, cat nap, nurse, cat nap, etc.. at night she’ll sleep for longer chunks, 2-4 hours at a time, but only if I keep holding her. So not only does this not give me any time to pump anyways, but it feels like I’m barely keeping up with her appetite.
I go back to work in a month. She’ll be going to a daycare. So advice please on how to get her to sleep in her bassinet. And also to be happy with being bottle fed.

Edit: I also want to say that we've been able to talk about Hinduism really well. We read the stories and she loves to believe they're real as well. I'm able to calmly explain to her that they're just stories, intended to educate us on how to be nice. Unfortunately I also use this as ammo against Christianity, again exhibiting childish behavior.

I think part of the problem is that we've been having the mom and baby group at our house exclusively and she might see the toys as all hers???

Because she was so small when we first started breastfeeding, we introduced nipple shields, which have worked a treat. However, now that she's bigger, I'm keen to try and get her off them. We're not having much luck so far. She's very fussy when she feeds and is on and off the breast, so last couple of feeds have been with the shield all the time.

688,"My daughter was surrounded by diversity her entire life. She never saw people as a color. Kids were kids. Either they were fun and nice or they weren't. 

We moved to a less diverse area due to a job transfer. It was a big out of state move. Her school has a small percentage of African American children and they all seem to be in her class. They have super low reading levels, behavioral issues etc.. She decided that she doesn't like them. At first I said give them a chance.  Get to know them. Most of your friends in your last school were not white. She promised she would try. Nothing changed. I asked her what she doesn't like about them. She said the crawl around on the floor Making noises when they are not supposed to, they throw the teacher's supplies, they talk back to the teacher, one child takes my daughter's school supplies and sticks them in her nose every day, one child put his foot in her lunch. It sounds like a special ed classroom to me. ICT would probably be more accurate because half the classroom does not have these issues. My daughter now sees which half has these issues and which half doesn't. 

I want to have her class switched. I don't like how it's impacting her views of non-white people when she just had a magical experience in a diverse environment. Having said that, I don't want to go to the school and be honest. I'm not a racist. If anything I feel like I'm trying to protect her from becoming a racist. 

My daughter had to say goodbye to a lot of really good friends. She came here with an open mind excited to meet new friends and now she's stuck in what I believe is an unofficial ICT class that was put together this way on purpose and she's completely miserable.

We're lucky to live near a couple of nice playgrounds where she can safely climb and explore. However I started thinking it would be nice to put her in some kind of class or program that offers a new kind of challenge. Does anyone have any recommendations along those lines?

690,"My daughter, R, is almost 3 and she's pretty advanced as far as communication goes.  For the past 4-6 months, she has stopped listening to me.  Here is an example of an exchange between us: 

Me: ""R, will you come down stairs please?""  
Her:""Why?""  
Me: ""We need to go, please come down.""  
...  
""Come on hun, let's hurry.""  
Her: ""No.""  
Me: ""Come down stairs.""  
No response.  
Me: ""R, COME DOWN STAIRS RIGHT NOW!""  

Usually, at this point she'll do what I say. Sometimes, I have to force her to do what I ask.  

Another, more common example (trying to enforce rules):
Me: ""R, don't sit on your sister (6mo), please.""  
Her: ""why?""  
Me: ""She doesn't like it. Get off.""   
Her: ""She doesn't like it?""  
Me, being dramatic: ""No, she doesn't like it.  See, she's crying now, you're hurting her. Get off.""    
Her: ""What did you say?"" -with no change in behavior.    
Me: ""I said get off of her. Get off, or you're getting a time out!""  
Still nothing.  Avoiding eye contact.  
""GET OFF RIGHT NOW!""  

At this point she will finally do what I ask, but about once in every 5 times, I have to physically fix the problem and then put her in time out. This situation is particularly hard (meaning I start shouting almost immediately)  when the rule involves her own safety, like holding my hand in the parking lot, or putting down a knife or climbing down off the counter.

But either way, immediately afterward I feel guilty, I'm a mean mom, and that I shouldn't have raised my voice.  After doing this ten times throughout the day, more if it's a particular busy day, I get to the yelling part faster and I feel super stressed out. She is starting to yell back at me sometimes as well.

 She does the exact same thing to her dad, except after asking her nicely 4 or 5 times, he just takes care of whatever it was himself.  

It's like she doesn't take it seriously until I'm mad. Should I just yell to begin with? Should I only ask nicely repeatedly until she obeys? I feel like there should be a middle ground, and I thought I was there, but it's stressing me out and I'm afraid of what kind of behavior this will lead to. Am I too impatient? 

Any advice for either fixing my attitude/behavior or hers?  Are there any parents out there with experience with this?

691,"My dearest friend lost her grandfather 7 months ago.  He was not religous and the family communicated this to the hospital many times.  Shortly before he passed they took him home from the hospital because his last wish was to die at home.  When the time to transfer him came, one of the nurses laid her body over her grandfather and began praying and saying ""it's not too late"".  This lasted a few minutes and the mom specifically said to stop.  The mom also works at the hospital, and was afraid to tell her employer because she doesn't want to get in trouble or have it create hostile work environment.

692,"My fiancé and I are not parents (someday, but not yet), but every year around this time I can't help to think about how we might celebrate the holidays with our kids. Here is a quick background:

We are both atheist. I am from a Roman Catholic family. She is from a Jewish family. We enjoy the season, the traditions of Christmas and Hanukah, being with our families, exchanging gifts, and the fun of it all.

Christmas we've got worked out, as Santa offers an easy means of disassociating the religious aspects of the holiday from the traditions of gifts, trees, cookies, most (read: the non-religious) songs/jingles, etc.

However, I am a little conflicted about how to handle Hanukah. Currently, we exchange Hanukah gifts... but (perhaps a bit contradictory to our beliefs) my girlfriend and I also light a Menorah and recite the traditional blessings in Hebrew, each night. We like the tradition of doing this, and not necessarily the translation of each blessing; for context:

&gt; 1. Ba-ruch A-tah Ado-nai E-lo-he-nu Me-lech ha-olam a-sher ki-de-sha-nu be-mitz-vo-tav ve-tzi-va-nu le-had-lik ner Cha-nu-kah.
&gt; 2. Ba-ruch A-tah Ado-nai E-lo-he-nu Me-lech Ha-olam she-a-sa ni-sim la-avo-te-nu ba-ya-mim ha-hem bi-zman ha-zeh.
&gt; 3. Ba-ruch A-tah Ado-nai E-lo-he-nu Me-lech Ha-olam she-heche-ya-nu ve-ki-yi-ma-nu ve-higi-a-nu liz-man ha-zeh.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Blessed are You, Lord our G-d, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to kindle the Chanukah light.
&gt; 2. Blessed are You, Lord our G-d, King of the universe, who performed miracles for our forefathers in those days, at this time.
&gt; 3. Blessed are You, Lord our G-d, King of the universe, who has granted us life, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this occasion.

720,"My one year old started daycare for the first time last week. She as to be expected started getting a bit sick stuffy nose a little fussy but no fever. I dropped her off at daycare this morning with a sealed store bought juice container and told them to use it as her sippy cup today for water. ( I often do this with her to get her to drink more water, goldfish brain doesn't remember she already drank all the juice)

I picked her up this afternoon because she had a fever. In the car she was screaming like she was in pain, so I knew something was wrongSo I didn't even bother taking her home I went straight  to the dr. At the doctor's office while I was checking in, she kept handing me her cup and screaming. I checked it and the seal was still on and she wasn't getting anything out of the cup.

So for the 6 hours my daughter was in their care, nobody checked her cup. Nobody even mentioned that she wasn't drinking anything which is like a major red flag for sick kids.

I broke down in the middle of the doctor's office as my little baby chugged her whole cup twice all the juice and some water a nurse was nice enough to get her.

When I spoke to the doctor I explained what I thought happen. The doctor explained that if my daughter had been given water and was showing these signs of dehydration then it was possible something more serious was happening but otherwise the symptoms she was showing had an easy and logical fix. (Sunken eyes, chapped bleeding lips, sores inside her mouth, and just overall extreme fussiness).I confirmed with the daycare they do not offer any drinks outside of water in the cup provided by us and occasionally milk with lunch  , before I started bring my children.

I confronted the teachers when I went to pick up my older son. They didn't apologize. They did say they would make sure it didn't happen again.

He din't have a particular time for his meltdowns and he was NEVER happy. So I took him to another doc (the family practice doc I have been seeing since high school and trust very much) and she suspects reflux. She told me to cut out dairy and some other things and ordered some scans. The diet changes  seemed to have helped a ton for about a week, so I cancelled the scan. Then it all started again, this time with diarrhea. So I took him back and she ordered a GI floroscopy scan and a pyloric ultrasound for next week. Now he is suddenly a mostly happy baby again. He fusses more than many, but it isn't constant shrill screams anymore and we do get a good amount of time with a happy baby. Basically, it is manageable now. I am terrified of the amount of radiation required for the floroscopy and not thrilled about the discomfort it might put him in for the moment (although I can get past that). If I knew he would stay like this I would cancel again, but I think he will probably go back and forth. I think I might prefer to wait and see if these ""happy"" stints get more frequent or get longer. If this is going to work itself out soon, I don't want to put him through all of that. I guess my question is, Does that seem unreasonable, I know the doc will think so? or should I just go ahead and have it done so that we can stop worrying every time he has a bad spell and give some answers for the doc to work with?

745,"My son was born in Wisconsin in 2010. Since then, I've moved to New Jersey where I'm from, and then to New York for a new job. My son didn't move to NY with me, because I hadn't established myself yet. He's been living with my parents, and attending school there. I finally signed a lease on a 2 bedroom apartment last month, and now I'm happily preparing to move my son back in with me.

When I signed my LO up for school in NJ, there was a custody agreement question, but the tiny, rural school district was pretty lax about following up on it. My concern is that the state of NY will be a lot more strict about confirming that I have full custody of my son. The truth is that my son's dad and I technically have joint custody. So far, we've have an amiable and unspoken agreement that (within the US) I can move wherever I decide with our son, and he will not challenge it. He has every right in the world to go to a Wisconsin court and demand that I move back here so that he can be near his child. But instead, he's let me make choices that make more sense for myself and my little family, and I really do respect and appreciate the absence of drama in the ""baby daddy"" section of my life. I only have roots on the East Coast anyway; if I didn't live here I'd probably be living back in Wisconsin, near my son's dad/half-siblings, and my old friends.

I've moved around quite a bit in the past so some documents of mine have quite disappeared, specifically our custody agreement. I can probably call the WI courts and request a copy, but the custody agreement will say that we have joint custody. According to the NY school registration website,  ""Parents must be able to demonstrate they are the person in parental relation to the child, over whom they have total and 
permanent custody and control.""

I'm not sure how to go about this. It's definitely feasible to contact his father and have him write up a statement that it's okay, but will he need a notary public? Also, never in the past have I called him to ask for documents. He'll agree to it, but I'm afraid that there might be some delay on his part. I'd rather avoid the trouble, unless I have no other choice.

So first of all, we don't need car seats. We don't have a car, and we live in a European city where we get around by walking and with public transport (which is normally quite accommodating to strollers). The only thing that I'm worried about here is how I'm going to get them home from the hospital, because I don't want to get car seats just for the one trip... but maybe that's for a different post.

For our general needs, I would really like to have a side by side stroller that takes bassinets for when they're babies (which they can nap in whenver/wherever), and can be upgraded to normal stroller seats for when they're older. I plan to walk around with them quite a lot (e.g. taking the dog for a walk every day or so) so I'd like something sturdy but light enough to do that. As I said, we don't have a car, so the foldability of the stroller isn't a huge concern.

I've been looking at the Bugaboo Donkey2 Twin, and I'm pretty sure it's my dream stroller because it has everything I'm looking for. Also, I've heard good things about Bugaboo. The only thing is it's very expensive (and I haven't been able to find any second hand ones nearby), so I'm wondering if there are other similar options that are a bit more affordable?

I'm outgoing with friends or planned gatherings, it's just strangers I don't want to get to know. I'd have been better off living in Europe. 

Going out is ruining my enthusiasm for it. This weekend we took all 3 kids out. The oldest has always attracted his own attention. We went to the mall to look for shoes. About 30 minutes in I told my wife I was done and I'd order them off amazon. We were stopped 3 f'ing times. One lady realizing I was irritated said: ""I have twins myself, that's why I was asking"". Lady if that's true, then you should know why you shouldn't be bothering me. I wanted to say. 

Looking at shoes, I couldn't concentrate because an employee went full on ""coochee coochee coo"" with the twins and I had to get her attention to find me a size. 

Going out by myself is a tad bit easier, because I'm over 6 foot and a natural angry rest face, but it still happens. I don't like being the center of attention. I don't like people wanting to see them. My wife laughs at some of my rants about it, but it's actually bothering me. 

Today I got ""So.............( really long pause for her prepared line). WHATS THEIR NAMES"" (in an Oprah voice like she's asking the big question in all the gossip columns). I told my wife I was going to say Jackson and Noah just so I don't have to open myself up to further discussion. 

I'm glad I can now do errands my wife would do on her way home from work. Which has actually backfired because she stays later and gets caught in more traffic.

751,"My wife and I have been matched with an expecting mom that was due in February.  We officially matched back in October but we've been communicating with her since July.  

Early on she told us she became pregnant through sexual assault and wanted nothing to do with this baby.  She wouldn't take money from us and she eventually cooperated with our agency.  Hell, in October we drove eight hours to meet her for a weekend.  As the months passed my wife and I began to feel pretty confident that this was finally going to happen.

Fast forward to last week when my wife googled her name (she googles her name every month) just to keep her mind at ease.  Well, this time she found a newly created baby registry with our expecting mom's name and her newest boyfriend.  We carefully asked her about the registry and she blew up on us, denied she made it, and then blew up our agency.

Our agency called us today to tell they're not working with her anymore because of how she behaved (she's been especially nasty to the social worker at the agency).  The expecting mother told the agency that my wife and I had betrayed her for the last time and she would find another family.

Our conversation with her today ended with her blaming our agency and saying she is not keeping the baby and strongly suggested she won't choose us.  When I ask her to clarify what that means she went silent.  

My wife cried for hours when she found that baby registry.  I can handle 1000 failed adoptions but I can't handle seeing my wife so upset.  We've been together since 2004, in our early 30s, and have no children (she cannot have them).

He is on the list to go for a full assessment (should be in by the end of this summer) where we hope to be given some sort of diagnosis or direction, but in the meantime we are left wondering what the cause of his delays is. The unknown is frustrating in that we just want to know what it is we should be doing to help him out. He has made lots of progress and is starting to use more words, even putting some together, and will now attempt to do things like dress or put on his boots.

I am a FTM due in mid-January. I have already discussed with HR my short term disability benefit and FMLA job protection. The company also offers 3 weeks of maternity leave paid at 100% of my salary and it kicks in after my STD benefit has been exhausted. STD + mat leave would be about 8 weeks and the other 4 weeks of FMLA job protected time off would be unpaid. 

I did NOT inform HR that I do not plan to return to work when FMLA time has run out as I do not want to lose my job and therefore my STD and maternity leave benefits. I have spoken to my STD insurance carrier and I will not lose any benefit there or be required to repay any premiums to them as long as I continue to work and pay into the STD until I deliver. My question is more regarding how to ensure I still get my employer sponsored maternity leave (my HR department is very small and indiscreet and I do NOT feel comfortable posing this scenario to them). One person (not at my company) said I would need to return to work for one day so that the company could not try to recoup my mat leave benefit/pay. My husband agrees with this, but no where in the employee handbook does it state what would (or would not) happen if I did not return from leave. I would like to keep a good professional relationship with this company, so I would think that after I have been paid for my maternity leave, but before I am due to return to work I should let them know I do not intend to return . They will already have a temp in place while I'm gone and I would feel better about giving them ""notice"" versus showing back up for one day and then leaving them in the lurch. But honestly, we are counting on that 3 weeks of fully paid leave to cushion my transition into SAHP-hood. So, has anyone been through anything similar?

I’m wondering how important “being a preemie” is to a child/adult’s identity. While the whole experience is a huge part of my identity as a first time parent and it was really difficult, he’s not going to remember being in the NICU. I’m so proud of what he accomplished there, but I can’t decide if we should make a huge deal about it when he’s old enough to understand or just matter of fact tell him. 

My gut is telling me to just treat him like a normal child and not make it a huge part of his identity.

794,"Our girls are 4.5 months and I’m thinking about moving them into their own room. Since about a week in, my husband and I have slept in different rooms with one twin each because if one wakes up, the whole family wakes up. It’s honestly worked really well for us and we don’t feel too sleep deprived. The problem is I’m still getting up every 4 hours to pump and my twin always wakes up when I do so I have to feed them (they don’t latch so we bottle feed) and it ends up taking about an hour to get back to sleep. The twin with my husband usually makes it to 4, 5, or even 6 am before needing a bottle. 

They nap in their room but one is so fidgety and noisy that she wakes the other. We spend the whole nap staring at the baby monitor and running in at the first grunt to try and keep the other one asleep. The grunty one is actually a good sleeper but her sister wakes at the slightest floorboard creek. Of course, right?

Any tips? What did y’all do? Anything you wish you did differently? Should we wait until they’re sleeping a full 10-12 hours before moving them? Since they do still wake up around 4 ish, I’m nervous that we’ll have to jump up and rush to get the bottle before they wake completely and start screaming, then never go back down. I’m honestly just nervous to rock the boat too. But everyone in my bumper group swears that everyone sleeps better when they’re out of your room and that sounds nice.

796,"Our son will be turning 4 in August and we are expecting twin girls this October.  My husband and I both work full time and make fairly average wages, but daycare costs are going to be astronomical once the twins arrive.  I started looking around at daycare assistance programs and in NJ (where we currently live) the maximum income for a family of 5 is something like $74K to be able to qualify.  When you take into consideration the cost of living for NJ...that number is crazy! I looked at PA for reference, and the maximum income level was something like $58K.

Seven days ago we received the diagnosis and I have cried every day since. I have cried more than I have ever cried in my life. I have been angry. I have been heartbroken. I have felt defective and like a failure. I had one job, growing a healthy normal baby, and I failed. I have blamed myself. 

Everything I have felt has come from a place of fear. Fear that my son will be stared at. Fear that he won't have friends. That he won't be loved. That he will be made fun of. But my son is still here. 

I have been scared that both of us will be judged. That I am going to miss out on having so many experiences as a Mum. That I will never have grandchildren or go to my Son's wedding. But my son is still here. 

All of that has been about me. My son is still here. He didn't die. He is just different. 

In life nothing is guaranteed. There is no guarantee that any of the things I had dreamt for him would have happened. There is no reason that many of the things I dreamt about can't still happen.

It has been seven days and what I have realised is that my son is still here. The little man who makes funny faces, who has hair that looks like dandelion fluff, and has worked out in just 15 days that if he fusses enough I will cuddle him until he falls asleep. 

He may never be tall like his Daddy and Uncle. He may never be a boxer, or hip hop dancer, or runner, or swimmer. He might not get the top score on his exams. He might not run a marathon. He might not fall in love. But then again, he might.

So some background info. I was married for 4 years to a man who lied to me about wanting to have children. I always wanted kids, he said be did until we got married and then he said no. So i divorced him but i was 39 at the time and thought my chances were gone. Met a man, got drunk and surprise got pregnant. I love my son more than anything else in this world. The father once we found out I was pregnant said he was happy and would be there for me and our baby.  Then 8 weeks into the pregnancy he disappeared, called me some very nasty names and threatened me.  I dont believe in abortion, if you do that's fine I dont judge it just was something i would never consider for myself. So I knew at that point i was doing this alone. I was fine with that. I was excited to finally have a baby.

I messaged the father once my son was born, legally I was told that it was the right thing to do to make myself look good. He proceeded to degrade me because I did not name my son after him but named him after my father. I was told to message him so i have written proof of our conversations. So I have his entire rant at me calling me a psycho bitch and the such.

A week ago he messaged me. Due to my state being in lockdown he got to thinking about me and my son and would like to see us and meet ""his"" son once this pandemic is over. And he asks if there is anything he needs. I tell him he lacks for nothing that my family and I make sure he has everything he could ever need. 

Legally I said yes to him meeting him as I was told it makes me look good and if or when he cancels that's on him.

So reddit world what do you think I should do. It scares the hell out of me to meet up with this man after all the abusive things he said to me.

She has been in a serious relationship her AP (23M) whom she met and cheated on me with 6 months ago while we were supposed to be attempting to save our marriage from her two previous instances of infidelity. Supposedly, this guy is the one she's been searching for her whole life. She can't wait to build her future with him, for him to play a father figure role in our sons life, and to have his babies. He makes her be a better person and makes her have stronger, better morals. All that good bs stuff people like to hear...

The point of this post is to get an opinion on what a proper time frame of her introducing her adultery partner, in any capacity, to our son is. Obviously, I can't stop her from doing anything she wants to do while my son is on her time. And I have plenty of reason to believe this is something she's already done, though she maintains otherwise.

Our divorce is not yet final. And, according to an LPC my son and I have been seeing, he still has a lot of adjusting to do in regards to the separation. The counselor suggested that my STBXW's SO not be introduced to our son until the divorce is final This has been communicate to my STBXW straight from the counselor. However, it has recently come to my attention that my STBXW and her AP plan to move in together as early as next month. She currently lives in a small 1 bedroom apartment, and when I asked if she'd be moving into a bigger place with him she said no because she can't afford it.

I am extremely upset by this. I DO NOT want my son sleeping in the same bed as this other guy. I barely want him sleeping under the same roof as this guy. My ex and I did co-sleep, but I feel that is extremely different than her and her bf co-sleeping with our son. Any time the subject, or even just the thought, of this guy having anything to do with raising my son comes up I become extremely agitated. He hasn't really done anything that would cause me to think he's a danger to my son. I just feel that his moral compass is all kind of messed up, being that he would sleep with a married woman who he knew was supposed to be working on her marriage. Am I wrong to feel this way?

Backstory: I am severely nearsighted, so I wear glasses so I don't damage my eyes by holding a screen right in front of my eyes. I used to have a pair reminiscent of super man's alter ego Clark Kent and that resulted in a rather fun and wholesome experience.

Story: I was walking to the library to hang out with a friend like a bookworm, and I arrived early. I went into the kids section because they have the dork diaries series.

I sat down and began reading while I waited for said friend, and an older lady walked in with about a 4-5 year old. The boy had short, neatly combed hair, and the lady had a curly looking perm. 

The kid walks by and notices my glasses and says in the cutest voice I have ever heard ""Superman!"" The lady chuckles a bit and sits down, telling him to run along and find your book, and she starts talking to me. 

""Aw, I'm sorry if you were embarrassed, he just loves his superhero comics, and Superman is his favorite."" I calmly tell her not to worry, and it happens a little more often than you might think.

We end up talking and we come across the subject of his birthday. Around this time I thought this would go in R/entitledparents with the title ""lady steals my glasses so her kid can be Superman.""

828,"Single Father’s sometimes do not have it the easiest depending on who you ask. 

Take me for example. 

Just before me and my ex split; I thought I had life all figured out. I was going to be married with a beautiful woman &amp; watch my beautiful little girl grow up and I’ll be the one to teach her things and watch her grow. 

The mother has left me a long time ago; due to no longer being emotionally attached anymore; and has taken my little girl with her. Now; of course, I do get to see my little girl on weekends. But, really, when is that ever enough? 

Being just a weekend parent; it’s hard. Not in the sense of raising her. 

Because That’s the hard part. That I can’t raise her. I can’t teach her things. I can’t show her new things. Instead, she’s showing me new things that she’s learned. I don’t get to watch her learn it anymore. I have to see it secondhand. Waiting a whole week just to see what she’s now learned. 

The hard parts for me are waiting so many days just to see her again, wanting more time with her that her mother doesn’t allow, and just not being able to watch my child grow. It’s like every week she’s getting bigger and bigger. Coming back to the house and learned something new. It hurts man...really does. 

The hardest thing yet...? Her mother has a new boyfriend. I was driving to the house one day with my little girl in the backseat ; and she referred to her boyfriend as “Daddy” and called me by my name. That’s the day I felt like I lost my little girl completely. When she referred to another man as Daddy. I felt like I had my heart completely ripped out my chest. I asked my child’s mother about it and she simply replied “I cannot correct her if that’s what she wants to call him.” It felt like a low blow. Like I lost my child that day. Now, of course I didn’t lose my little girl. But it just felt like it. 

A lot of people ask me ; “why don’t you ask for more time with her?” Well; let’s refer to this. My child’s mother does not work. A lawyer told me the state would not grant me a lot of time with my child. Weekends at most. So I privately asked my child’s mother and she told me “She cannot be away from our child for more than 2 days in a row” 

The hardest parts are sleeping in the same house that you watched all the memories happen from your ex and child. When it’s late at night; silent; all the lights are off; and you can just vision flash backs of them playing. Your little girl screaming for you to come play too. The perfect family. The greatest thing a man can ask for. 

I work hard everyday to give my little girl everything and even with that ; that isn’t even enough. I would give up my job and everything I have just to watch my little girl grow up. To watch her first day at school, ride a bike for the first time. All of it. Instead ; I sit at home. Waiting to see what she’s learned. 

My child’s mother is not spiteful one bit and I’d hate to see if she was. But ; as a father who has lost the one thing in life he desired most. And that was to watch his little girl grow. It changes him. It makes him more quiet. It makes him scared of starting anything with anyone again. It kills him from the inside. It makes him fear women. 

I...am a father who lost the one thing in life that I could of cherished most. I am a father who would give it all up to have it all back. 

I am a broken man, but a strong man for my little girl. I love her...even if she might grow up one day and think I am not her father. But I beg to a god, if there is one, that she does.

Now suddenly the local hospital is refusing to let me give birth there because of ""staff shortage"" which is total BS. They don't need two MDs because the midwife is there as the second. They want me to travel tons hospital in the city that is about an hour plus away. 

Here is my problem: I have two children age 9 and 2.5, who knows what time of day I'll go into labour  I am guessing it's going to take 30-60 minutes to make all the arrangements when the time comes to get ahold of the people and set our plan in place for the children to be taken care of. Second problem: my labours are hard and fast, I'm talking NO breaks between contractions, just constant peeks and building up to stronger more painful contractions the ENTIRE TIME. I am estimating that depending on traggic and the ongoing highway construction it will be another hour and 45 minutes to to the hospital, bot to even mention thebdamn registration and finding a place to park. Third problem : the weather ! No idea if there will be a snow storm. We don't have friends or family we can stay with leading up to the due date, we can't afford a hotel room and Neal's for who knows how long. Husband still has to work, oldest has to go to school. I am terrified of traveling away from home, tondeliver in an unfamiliar hospital with doctors I haven't met and not being able to have my midwife with me ( stupid jurisdiction rules). Not to mention my labours are quick as in under 4 hours from water breaking to holding baby in my arms quick. So I am scared of having these babies on the side of the road and there being complications. 

This is causing me a lot of anxiety and stress, I can't sleep at night because of all the worry. And having suffered PPD/A after both pregnancies,  zi feel this experience will be detrimental to my mental health. 

I am feeling very scared, uncared for by the system and a pawn in the inter politics between the midwives and the hospital flexing because ai chose midwifery care over them.",True,child behavior problem

832,"So I had my son April 3rd, he was born at 7lb 14oz.  The hospital told me to give him 1 oz every 4 hours,  and I did that for the first day. He does fine with his formula so far -  no spit up,  doesn't act fussy,  his poops are seedy and aren't too solid, and he doesn't get too gassy.  I do burp him every half an oz or so,  though.  Anyways,  starting the second day he started getting very very fussy after he ate his oz. We gave him a pacifier and it seemed to quell that problem.  However,  sometimes it doesn't work and I can tell he is still hungry.  He'll spit out his pacifier and root around,  try to suck his hand,  stick out his tongue,  ect.  

The hospital got angry at me for topping off with a few extra ml. They told me I was going to over feed him.  This confused me,  because I thought infants need to be fed on demand. 

Now,  at home,  he's not acting satisfied until he gets about 2 Oz every 2-4 hours.  I don't want to overfeed him,  and his pediatrician appointment isn't until Thursday so I'm not really sure what to do. I'm a new mom so I'm super new with all of this and have no idea what I'm doing.  I don't want my baby to go hungry,  but I'm worried that I'm doing something wrong.  Is there really a strict schedule I have to follow? The hospital nurses acted like since I was formula feeding I have no idea what I'm doing,  and that I'm just shoving a bottle at him every time he cries.  They weren't very helpful at all.  

I feel like less than a week old is a little too early for a parent led schedule,  but I don't really know that for sure.  All I know is my baby seems really hungry,  the nurses told me to not feed him so much,  but I think he should be able to eat when he wants on demand.",True,discipline

I pumped 4 oz tonight and attempted to scald it. I put it in my smallest pan. I read online that you just want the edges of the pan to start bubbling... however mine went straight to a boil. I had the pan on medium... should I have it on low? Is that milk now a waste since it went to a boil (it didn't thicken or anything, I took it off immediately...) Ugh.

836,"So I stopped my last pack of birth control (pill) in late December, had AF after a 30 day cycle. I was traveling for work that cycle so didn't track anything but around the middle definitely had a lot of EWCM. Started tracking in cycle 2, though not well.
I am now on CD40, with no AF in sight. I was freaking out last week (CD 34) and decided to take an OPK and got a positive and had EWCM. So husband and I BD'ed. Luckily we also BD'ed on CD30 and CD32, but we used a water-based lube (just found out that is not ok). Since CD34 my temp has been up. On CD36 I had what I think is ovulation pains (left side only, under hip bone) all day. Both Fertility Friend and Ovia have no clue what is going on. They both say I'm either DPO4 or DPO 6, however, FF says I could be ovulating right now.
I may have also have ovulation pains (felt different than on CD36, these felt like a side stitch in my abdomen) on CD 31 and CD33.
Before birth control, I had pretty regular AF (30-31 day cycles) though its always been pretty light.
I just keep reading everything for more information and it is making me super anxious. If I am not pregnant, that means I have no clue when my next cycle will be.

Edit: Sorry, I have taken two pregnancy tests. CD31 and CD33. All the OPK's I have taken since CD 34 have been negative.",True,
837,"So I went on a significant hike with my two year old the other day.  (Well, significant as in it had a lot more elevation gain than I would take a small child on for the length considering what kind of shape the adults are in.)  He did great.  But it was the first time he had gone to the bathroom outside.  I've been avoiding it (although we have used plenty of public bathrooms and portapotties even) because I wanted to reinforce that potty/poop goes in the toilet.  

At first he was refusing to go.  I finally picked him (with his pants and underwear off) so he was held in front of me while I was leaning over.  I put his legs over my arms, spreading them apart.  He held onto my arms.  It's kind of hard to explain, but basically I was holding him in a squat position.

It worked great.  He seemed to feel supported and I could aim his pee and poop where I wanted it to go.  Now he needs to learn a better method by next summer, because he's going to be too big for me to hold him like that.

The one problem is that I may have said kind of loudly to my husband and parents that I made a great poop chair.  I have a feeling that that is never going to go away.",True,
838,"So I'm a 21yo, SAH, first time mom. My son is going to be 9mo in about 2 weeks. I grew up with strict authoritarian, emotionally abusive parents and as a result, I battle with depression and rage/agression. I'm short tempered and often impatient. My parents believed in 'spare the rod, spoil the child' and it's encouraged feelings of physical rage (i don't actually get into fights but I'm always angry and derive enjoyment/relief from smacking and hitting things) that I'm constantly fighting to control. When I decided to accept the commitment of parenthood, I told myself that I did not want my child raised the way I was raised, I didn't want him to constantly be fighting against himself to behave like a decent human being. That's why I chose attachment parenting. And while I'm positive that it's the route I want to take with my child(ren), I struggle when he has his days of crying too much or when he won't listen to me. I want to lash out when I'm at my wits end but he's a baby. He's only doing what a baby does. He doesn't yet have the ability to verbalize his needs and our adult rules go aginst his infant's curiosity and nature. I know this, and knowing this, it doesn't make sense for me to spank him or yell at him for things he doesn't yet understand. And yet, that's what my first thought is. I'm constantly having to pull myself away from my son to calm down and not react the way I've been taught, and it kills me and it scares me. I'm scared that one day I won't be able to pull myself away in time. I'm already looking for a therapist to talk to, and I've been to therapy before, though I didn't find much help besides dealing with my depression. I'm hoping it goes better this time around. But what else can I do? How can I successfully rebel against the authoritarian parenting style I was taught so that I can follow AP? And what are some age appropriate ways to discipline him without spanking him or yelling? I don't want to let him CIO, and sitting down to explain things to him doesn't seem to be working too well for me. What do you guys suggest? Thanks you guys.

841,"So I'm in the unfortunate situation of awaiting some test results after finding out that our cute little baby (which looks normal to me on a 12 week ultrasound) actually is at high risk for a number of chromosomal issues, the most common of which is Down's Syndrome.

The NT measurement came back 3.0mm. Upon second measurement at the genetic office, the measurement came back 3.1mm. We are 12 weeks plus a few days.

My wife and I have made the decision that we're not going to end the pregnancy based on any kind of disability, but it would be nice to know and have time to prepare. We're currently awaiting the California State Screening test, which includes PAPP-A and HCG, which combined with age should give us some kind of % likelihood for defect.

Following that, we'll be conducting an NIPT test which will let us know with high accuracy the likelihood there is something wrong. We probably won't move forward with a CVS or amnio unless there is a very compelling reason.

Scary to say the least and I can't stop thinking about it, but I'm hoping and praying that everything is fine and normal. The genetic counselor tells us that with JUST the high NT measurement, no other factors included, the likelihood of something being wrong is 1/5. 

In all honestly, if the baby has an intellectual disability, then so be it. My wife and I will manage! I am worried about the baby having other issues. Heart problems, organ problems, if she won't live once she's born. Those thoughts really make me sad.

My relationship with her mother is one of many bad choices I've made in life, but I don't regret my amazing daughter for a minute. I love her unconditionally and want her to grow up to be a rational, thinking adult who realizes her full potential in life. My daughter is very intelligent and inquisitive, but her mother is not (putting it as politely as I can - I could rant for hours on that). The mother takes our daughter to some holy-roller church regularly, and I'm very afraid that they are going to indoctrinate her as much as they can and cause intellectual and/or emotional conflict for my child. I'm also afraid that if I reveal too much about my lack of belief and my utter disdain for religion to my daughter, that the mother could get vindictive and make it difficult for me to see my daughter or make my life miserable in other ways. Note that I live in Georgia, and her mother is in North Carolina. I'm moving there very soon. Regardless, neither state is very enlightened when it comes to domestic laws, and the courts tend to side with the mothers in matters related to child custody/visitation/support. And everyone here probably can guess how it is to live as an atheist in a Bible-belt state.

Wife and I started 6 days ago, poops have been generally pretty good only one miss. The pees have been a total mess unless we get her on the potty and she’s busy for a while. 

Pretty much all the successes have been due to us prompting her that it’s time to sit on the potty. Most times she says no! But sometimes when we time it right she’ll sit without complaint.

We started wondering on day 4 if were not making progress because we keep prompting her and shes not making the initiative.

But the same thing keeps happening she’ll just pee where she’s sitting or standing and not bat an eye. The wetness doesn’t seem to bother her at all.

Another thing we noticed today after a huge pee on the floor. We calmly explained that she has to let us know when she needs to use the potty, for ex. We said, “say mama potty! Or Papa potty”. She had kind of a zoned out look and then ran off to be alone.

My wife and I are worried that we are causing her extra stress over her inability to communicate and making it more difficult for her to let us know. But she doesn’t seem to mind the pee all on her legs so I’m not sure what to do.

I've been to doctors, confirmed there is nothing actually wrong with him, it's just completely pointless screaming for hours and hours at a time. He's fed, he's clean, he's not too hot and not too cold, I try cuddling in every position known to man, I try putting him down a million different (safe) ways, I try walking him, I try gas drops, I've tried changing his formula, I've tried literally everything under the sun, and nothing helps.

I feel like I'm losing my shit. I love this kid to pieces, and I'm normally a calm person, but I get so mad about the screaming it's frightening. I'd never in a million years hurt him. I always put him down if I'm even slightly worried I might be reaching anything close to a breaking point. But I have screamed at him, something I know isn't helping, and I'd be lying if I said I'd never gotten the compulsion to shake him. (again, I'd never in a million years do it, even at my worst the thought of actually hurting him makes me want to bawl my eyes out) I end up either crying with him, or, more often lately, just being absolutely furious for the last few hours of his screaming fit with zero way to calm down.

I live in a super small apartment, so it's not like I can put him safely in his crib and just get away from him long enough to calm myself down. The only close relative who could watch him for me works all evening, my husband doesn't get back until after 11 most nights, I'm just stuck with him alone the entire time 6 days out of the week, and even on my husbands day off I end up half helping him when ""he's watching the baby"". He's normally great, but he gets frustrated with the screaming even faster than I do.

I know I'm not the only person to ever have a colicky baby, so how in the world do you other moms and dads deal with it? I feel like I'm losing my mind.

861,"So something that should by definition be low stress for the expecting mom is suddenly turning into drama thanks to my family.

Two years ago, my older sister and I got married close to each other (mine was a bit over a month after hers). I chose my wedding date after she did, and she completely flipped out on me saying that I was making her day less special. I told her that I was not going to ask for help or anything special when it came to plans and events because I made the choice to do it close to her date and I understood if she was going to be overwhelmed with plans. Once she cooled off, she insisted that she could still be the maid of honor and do whatever is expected. She said that she wanted to help with everything and would plan the bachelorette and wedding shower. I did all the maid of honor stuff for her—planned the bachelorette, helped with the shower my family threw, etc. 

Well, we intentionally set a date for my bachelorette that was over a month before her wedding to minimize the stress because she swore she wanted to do it. Three days before, she called me in tears saying she was too stressed out and anxious to plan anything for me. My now husband had to step in and plan my bachelorette and it ended up being a great time, but I’ve always been hurt over it though I tried to just let it go to not upset her, since my family was already making me feel like the black sheep for making my wedding close to hers. (It’s worth mentioning that this is a pattern in my family, I often feel and my husband and friends have remarked that my family is much harder on me than they are on her.)

Fast forward to now, I’m due in June with my first (first grandkid on both sides). My family already made me feel like crap for wanting the same name as my sister, even though I didn’t know she liked the same name until she asked me about names and I mentioned our top choice, so there’s that. My mom and sister said a few months ago they wanted to plan my shower, and a few friends offered to help, so I said they could reach out to them and work together on planning.

People have now started to ask me about a shower date, and I hadn’t heard anything, so I texted my mom and sister, and it turned into a million anxious questions from them about the venue, date, and a list of addresses that suddenly needed to be submitted to them immediately. I’d worked a long day and honestly did not have the energy to plan my own damn baby shower, so I mentioned again that my friends offered to help. I said something to the effect of me not caring where it was or who planned it because I was sure it would be wonderful no matter what happened.

That turned into a text novel from my sister about how hurt she was that I said I didn’t care about who planned my shower. She said she thought my friends domineered my wedding planning and made her feel that she wasn’t as important to me as they were, and that she didn’t want to miss out on her chance to plan my party (wtf???). Honestly, I only mentioned my friends because I am worried that my sister will drop the ball like she did for my bachelorette. Of course, I didn’t say that to her and just said that I appreciated that she really wanted to help plan but that this was all adding tons of stress. Then, my mom texted later and said that I really needed to let my sister plan the shower and not my friends because “she loves you so much and wants to have the primary role.”

862,"So this is from my perspective, as the ""boyfriend"" (not official but just to give it a clear name).
Single mum and her baby, currently around 8 months old.

Dad is other side of the country, so he's around and he facetimes baby, gets pictures, but wont be able to physically visit too often. Every few weeks, at best, really. 

So there is a worry that if we keep seeing eachother, slowly as the baby gets older she will consider me her dad, and call me that, in the absence of seeing her actual dad as often as me. Now of course, when she gets older it can be explained, but for a long while it might be confusing. 

I dont have a problem with that in itself, only that i dont want to hurt the baby as she grows up, or confuse her, or upset her or anything like that, because of course like any potential relationship, it might just not work and i could ""disappear"".. and im not trying to take the place of her dad. 

The trouble is for various reasons due to her mum and dads work, she doesnt have the chance for them to babysit a whole lot, so the time we would like to spend together either needs to involve the baby, or needs to be cut drastically down to when she can get them to babysit. .. and in reality that could be once every 2 or 3 weeks which would put a strain on us in a way, but i understand if thats how it needs to be.

If you were the single parent in this scenario, or you have been, could anyone give me any advice about if you think we should stop before the baby gets attached, if we should deal with seeing eachother a lot less so the baby isnt as involved with me, or if you think we can carry on as we are, and find a way to make it work when she's getting a bit older and starting to understand stuff more (perhaps wen i see them, not be as involved with the baby in terms of playing, cuddling, feeding etc).

This is new ground for both of s, we really like eachother but particularly for her this is quite stressful, so any help is appreciated.",True,working parents
863,"So this may be stupid af. And I’m sorry. But my anxiety is kinda driving me insane. 
Anyways I was hooking up with this chick the other day. We had sex twice and a condom was used both times. Yay for being safe right. Anyways, the 2nd go around she starts giving me a blow job. And I get another condom and place it on. I’m scared that when I placed the condom on the 2nd time, it might have somehow made contact with left over cum. I’m scared that my hand I was stroking self with had cum on it mixed with her saliva from the BJ, and made its way inside her.  My hand was wet with her saliva. It’s not like I placed the condom on backwards and then flipped it over and rolled it down. But I still scared nonetheless. 
Idk if I’m being ridiculous but it’s just causing me to stress out a bit. Idk the probability of anything happening or if there any real risk. She’s no on BC either.....

864,"So two days ago I got my IUD put in. For a bit of context, this was in the UK under the NHS (woo), and I'm 20F just switched from being on a progesterone only pill (so the same hormones).

Th appointment itself took almost exactly half an hour, and the doctor was lovely! Made me feel as comfortable as I could have been, considering she was quite painfully poking me in the cervix.

She sat me down and explained all the risks to me, and told me there'd be three painful bits to the insertion. These were (if I remember correctly): her putting the speculum inside me and 'opening me up', her measuring my womb and finally the insertion of the coil.

She told me that sometimes during the procedure the cervix can go into spasm and make it impossible to get anything up there, so she got me to talk utter nonsense to her during to keep me relaxed.

I won't lie, it hurt a lot! I'd best explain the pain as a mix between a cramp and a sharp stabbing sensation, pretty much constantly from when she measured my cervix until she'd taken the speculum out when she'd finished.

The pain afterwards wasn't nearly as bad as I thought - it was more a stabbing pain than a cramp and I felt a bit sick, but by the time I had dinner that evening (my appointment was at 3:30) I felt fine.

866,"So we're both 30 and have been married for 2 years now. Our daughter just turned 9 weeks old, and I'm having a really tough time. I was never a ""baby person"" before, when relatives or friends had babies over I just avoided them, but I always thought that it would change when we had our baby, unfortunately it didn't. Don't get me wrong, I love my daughter with all of my heart, and when it's good it's great, but the good times are few and far between. It's starting to get a little better, but this is nothing like what I thought it would be when we were pregnant. All everyone talked about was how awesome it would be, and how it is going to change our lives for the better, but I just feel very overwhelmed and in over my head with all of this.

My wife is awesome with the baby, but I'm feeling like me not being so good with her is starting to wear on our relationship. I hate to think this, but it feels like she is starting to come between us. Honestly it feels more and more like our family is my wife and daughter with me on the outside looking in. I try to do as much as I can to be involved, but I just get increasingly frustrated with the baby and her crying all the time. One of the worst parts about it is that whenever I try to talk to other parents about it they all just act like it's no big deal and everything is fine.

I talked to my mom about it because I know that I was a sick, colicky baby, and she went through post partum depression with me, and she says that this is how she felt with me. I always thought that was a mother thing, but is this something that dads can go through as well? I'm not necessarily looking for answers or anything, but it just feels good to get this off of my chest. I talked to my wife about it and she says that she understands, but it still feels like she is getting frustrated with me because I'm having a hard time with our daughter.

I really just miss the way things were with us before we had a baby. We both wanted to have a baby, and I'm happy that she is here and healthy, but most of the time I wish it was just the two of us again...

869,"So when we first started juggling our life with twins my first thought was to come here and look for inspiration on how exactly to make all this work. How do you stay sane, find time for yourself, get everything done and manage to do it all over again the next day. Combine the fact that my wife and I are both military and we decided to breastfeed it makes things a delicately orchestrated ballet. So I figured I'd put this up to help anyone that may be trying to juggle similar circumstances. A day in the life so to speak...

So, we begin:

**0400:** My wife wakes up and starts breastfeeding the first baby in the nursery. As of right now, a bit over 2 months, the girls sleep in a twin bassinet pack and play at the base of our bed. This time also includes changing them out of their sleeper for skin on skin breastfeeding, a fresh diaper, and into the outfit for the day. Usually their both asleep, but sometimes if one is fussy they get put on dads chest to cuddle and sleep in while the other is looked after. 

**0430:** Wax on wax off, the process repeats for our second little one while their sister is in her crib, usually crying. Get used to it… mom only has two hands. So now before you grab your pitchforks for dad… there is a reason. He has to be functional to drive in the morning so he gets about 30-45min extra “sleep”. 

**0500:** The girls are put in the second pack in play downstairs, or one in the swing one in the pack and play if they’re being particularly fussy, while we get ready for work. What this entails… so, and I’ll get to this part later. Magically in the morning we have bottles that are filled with the previous days breast milk, lunch cold bits ready to grab out of the fridge with dry bits already waiting in the cooler. Bags are packed, with last minute additions being minimal, trust me if you leave it to the morning you WILL forget… Sleep being what it is. A few last minute additions such as putting the girls in their fuzzy bear suits to make the cold trip to the car. Bonus points, because they love their bear suits and always stop crying when the get put in them, like a warm blanket it puts them out. 

**0530:** Out the door and loading the girls up into their car seats. We decided against the removable ones because let’s face it unless you have killer lats, you’re not going to be carrying both like that. Props if you can pull it off. We decided to go with the Pria 70 which is a convertible. We did also liked that it had a wider growth range, and went all the way down to 4lbs with the tiny fit system, but I digress.

**0600:** we arrive on base, we usually get there a bit early but it buys us time in our schedule if we need to run by our work to grab something or if we hit traffic on the way in. 

**0615:** One of us gets dropped off at the Gym for our morning formation/workout time (0630-0730),  

**0630:** The other parent is dropping the girls off at the CDC (Child development center, aka daycare). This logistical juggle of breast milk cooler, replacement outfits, diapers, wipes, and both girls is best accomplished with a chest rig for one, a girl in the other hand, and a second trip for everything else… or the stroller assuming you don’t need the extra trunk space. A double stroller will take up your whole trunk pretty much no matter how you swing it. 

**0630-0730:** We both work out 5 days a week. Career field mandated fun time.

**0735~ :** We both shower at the base gym, our work has a shower area but there are limited shower heads, and time is premium. 

**0750:** Having showered and changed into our work uniforms we split ways. Mom heads to her office with a privacy shawl and starts one of her three pumping sessions of the day. Dad starts cooking breakfast at work and hoovers it and brings mom her share. Forgot to mention we work together… keep up now.

**0830-1000:** Misc work crap… blah blah spreadsheets, blah blah jammed missiles. 

**1000:** Mom starts her second pumping session.

**1000-1230:** Take a working lunch, eating at our desks. We do this so we can use our hour lunch break to do what comes next…

**1230-1300~** We go visit our girls at the CDC, and if the daycare has timed it right we can also work in a breastfeed. If breastfeeding isn’t possible 1300 is an extra pumping session. 

**1300-1530:** Work, work, work…

**1530:** Last pumping session. 

**1600:** Duty day ends, we try and change to go home. 

**1615:** Extra work crap that always comes up…. Working some more…finally get out the door. 

**1630:** Pick up girls together, head home

**1700:** Arrive home. Girls get carried in and put in the living room pack and play. We unload the car, a quick breath of sanity and we start the madness of preparing for the next day.

**1730:** Mom starts breastfeeding, dad cleans the day’s bottles “6-8 of them”, and transfers, marks and sets in the fridge the next days haul. Dad cleans moms pumping gear and it all gets thrown into a large Tupperware. Sometimes mom has time for cleaning pumping gear at work, but not always.

**1800:** Dinner is cooked… rock paper scissors? Pro tip, set something out for the following day. We vacuum seal large packs into “us” size servings, hopefully with leftovers, but damn mom can put back some food while pumping and feeding that much. So… best set out some stuff for lunch, load it all into a gallon freezer bag and have it ready to go for the morning. 

**1800-1900:** Us eating / consoling, blow off some steam with TV and the girls.

**1900:** Bath time for the girls, they don’t truly need one every day, but they like the routine of it and it sets them up to sleep. 

**1930:** Story time and winding down. We started with kids’ books, but damn if those don’t get old quick. So we transitioned to harry potter. The girls just like hearing our voices and it usually calms them enough to put them down in the bassinets in our room. Dad got veto’d on Steven King’s Gunslinger… Apparently a few too many Mother F’er’s…

**2000:** Girls get tucked in for the night. Baby monitor all set, mom and dad finish packing work bags… remember what I said about doing it while functional. 

**2030:** Catch our breath. We kick up our feet, we have me/us time. We spar/ box if we need to blow off steam, we play video games if we’re exhausted. We just try and buy some sanity time. The girls used to scream during this time, but we would go up and check on them every 15 minutes, calm them, and put them back down. Now they’re going down and staying down. Last night was the first time they slept all the way through 8pm to 4am, it’s not much but damn if it doesn’t feel good. 

**2100:** Mom adds an extra pumping session to help her supply and try and make it through the night herself. Have to be careful with not letting this one go too late in case the girls get “Hangry” around 2230. 

**2130:** Mom goes to bed. She usually does a midnight feed, but sometimes we get lucky. 

**2200:** Dad is done stalling or playing video games, and comes up to bed. 

**0000-0100:** Breastfeeding/dream feeding but they sleep through this one sometimes.

**0400:** do it all over again.

A few pro tips if we can be so bold this early on. The swing is a godsend, it works for our girls, if only we had two, but I can’t justify spending the money or having the space in the living room. Dual breast feeding would save us time, but individual mileage may vary, our girls wouldn’t cooperate with mom that way so one at a time it is. Divide and conquer with chores. Have a routine with the kids and it helps reinforce bedtime. Goes without saying but keep their feeds close together, you don’t have to wake them both, but wake the other one when the first is done feeding. Amazon mom’s subscriptions for stuff is awesome, just mind your frequency and size settings. Most of all just REALLY try and TRY to be flexible, you have to have a routine, just be willing to flex with it, it doesn’t happen instantly. 

Lastly as the girls get older I have to imagine this will change and adapt with them. Any veterans that can chime in with ways to improve, or things to look out for please do so.

Keep calm and caffeinate heavily… unless you’re breastfeeding… sorry mom. Caffeine made our girls gassy/fussy.",True,

871,"So, I’ll try to make this as to the point as possible and hope my mama emotions don’t take over. We made the tough decision to sleep train our son when he was 9 months old. Slept well for the most part after that unless he was teething or sick. He’s now about to be two next month. About a month ago, he started waking up again at night. Normally we would just go in and help him adjust and he’d fall back asleep. Then he started waking several times. And wanted to stay up. We tried putting him in the bed with us since I work at 5am everyday and was desperate for sleep but that didn’t help. Finally, last week, I’d had it and I let him cry it out. It took almost half an hour of crying but he’s slept through the night, or self soothed, since then. My husband works until after our son goes to bed so I’m on bedtime duty 5 nights a weeks. Every night for 3 weeks, he cries when I put him to bed. I’ve been very mindful of cuddling and positive reinforcement before bed so he feels secure. But he still screams. He doesn’t do this for my husband, or my mom when she babysits on occasion. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I know he’s been extra attached to me lately, and I’m sure his brain is on overload at this age,  but I can’t help but feel like I’m missing something here or that I’m doing something wrong.

 Then she started daycare. She was too shy to tell the teachers when she had to go potty, so she had an accident every day. I asked them to take her regularly to use the toilet, but I don't think they really tried. They asked us to bring her pullups.

I feel like the pullups were a terrible idea, and I asked the teachers three times to take her regularly to the toilet. Each time, they told me she is only two.

877,"So, the short version of my story is that I'm a mother of two. A (now) 6 week old boy and a 3.5 year old little girl. My boyfriend wasn't really able to stay home to help after our son was born, so I've been doing this whole thing by myself. In the hospital, my son was an incredibly disinterested latcher. He really enjoyed (and still does) sticking his tongue out or pushing it to the roof of his mouth during a feeding. I had four different nurses and a LC tell me 5 different ways to get him to latch, to hold him, what I was already doing (told by someone else) was wrong, etc etc etc. I didn't see the LC until about two hours before we were discharged. We tried and tried to get him to latch after getting home, but he would just cry, and flail his head around, and put his arms in his face...basically he did everything possible to make it impossible to feed him.

Add to that fact that he was colicky for the first five weeks of his life. We were up all night, there were very rare occasions where I could put him down long enough to go to the bathroom, let alone pump. Plus, my preschooler still needed attention. I tried pumping for 4.5 weeks. But, as my son's schedule became more and more inconsistent, I was getting less sleep, and we were generally having a bad time...my supply pretty much dropped to nothing. So I quit. I haven't pumped in just over a week and a half. The way my supply dwindled, I had no engorgement or pain after I quit.

HOWEVER, my son has, for the last week, finally started sleeping normally. He's eating ever 3-4 hours, and only getting up once, maybe twice, overnight. I'm able to get more sleep, my daughter has started to get into the routine of being a big sister, etc. So...I guess my question is. Has anyone else had to quit and then been able to successfully restart? I know it might seem silly, he's doing perfectly fine on the formula. But, I was unable to successfully BF my daughter as she was born prematurely and I just couldn't get anything to really come out when I pumped. I really want to be able to bond with my son over this, especially given our rough first couple of weeks.

I know I might have to combat nipple preference (though I've really tried to keep him eating from bottles with bigger nipples and obviously the slow flow) and perhaps a complete lack of interest in latching. I just want to try. But, not if I've screwed myself in terms of supply. I know I won't be easy..I just want to know it's possible. I want to know that even though I haven't pumped in a week and a half, and even though I was barely getting a half an ounce in one pumping session for days before that, that I can do this.

878,"So, we (M32, F30) lost our first pregnancy at 13 weeks and had been unsuccessful at getting pregnant again in the year and a half since then. We finally saw a fertility doctor and realized that one of my wife's tubes were blocked and I had a morphology issue with my sperm.

880,"Some back story: The hospital I gave birth at had a terrible lactation consultant, she was unable to get my baby boy to latch and blamed it on tongue tie, however the pediatrician confirmed that was not the case. We used a nipple shield for the first 2 weeks, which he had difficulty latching to as well, pushing my supply even further into the ground. I did not have access to a pump these first 2 weeks as there was an insurance issue and my company would not allow me to pre order my pump. at 2 weeks I was able to get a hygeia pump, however I was only pumping a 1/2 oz between my two breasts. I was able to visit with another LC who was able to get my son to latch without a nipple shield and started us on an SNS tube. We have been breast feeding with an SNS tube until last week (then dry pumping for 20 minutes), when for some reason he stopped latching properly with the tube. He is however latching properly breast only. Currently we are breastfeeding, then supplementing with a bottle. After the breast feed, I dry pump for 20 minutes. Today I skipped breast feeding and gave my son a bottle while I double pumped to see if I could figure out exactly how much I'm getting, and my stomach dropped when I could only get an oz, and could not wrangle a 2nd let down. 


I really want to start getting a stash together for while I am working, however at 1 oz a day I wouldn't even be able to come close to keeping up with his breast feeding needs currently. Has anyone else had this issue and solved it?

Also, I currently drink 94 oz of water a day, take fenugreek 3x3 daily, drink mother's milk tea 3x daily, eat oatmeal in the morning and also eat lactation cookies full of flax and brewers yeast.

We do give him a sippy cup of water at night which I assume won't help. Anything I can do to help him over come this hurdle? 

FYI, he is still in his crib and does not have access to get up and go potty alone at night. Should we convert to toddler bed and leave a potty in his room? Allow him to walk to our bedroom so we can help him at night? How is this normally done?",True,sinle parents

Since baby made an entrance 7 months ago, I've been struggling to cope with my new body (overweight , loose skin and stretch marks). I've had many breakdowns, alone and with DH and my anxiety has sky rocketed. Anyway, I'm losing track. 
Who am I?
I have no hobbies, minimal social interaction and my day revolves around baby and counting down till DH returns from work. I also have no interests. I know people will say you must like something but I really don't. I just don't know who I am. 
I rarely leave the house during the day. I know its not healthy for my son but I also find it hard to make it out the door. I hate where we live. It's tiny. One , ten minute walk route that is suitable for a buggy, I tried walking but there's only so many laps you can do before it gets extremely boring. 
My friends are childless so don't understand this struggle. My DH has many interests, music, gaming and reading, I envy this because I don't understand how I make myself have an interest in something. Before baby I read A LOT but between taking care of a baby, cleaning and cooking and just getting to talk to another adult in the evening, I just don't feel bothered to read. I want a shower, some food, a cup of tea and my bed. 
It is obvious my mental health isn't in a good place but I don't know how to fix this? I love my child to bits but I just feel lost? Like I don't have a personality anymore. I can't talk to people about anything else because I do nothing else!

My friend is asking me for a date and guest list for a baby shower she wants to throw for me after the baby is born in August. Im not generally an advocate for baby showers as it feels to me like you are asking for gifts. The party is being planned after the baby is born because it's when my  sister is back in the country. 

Basically, I am concerned if we don't word the invitation correctly it could sound rude. She is suggesting October, however if it's October most people will have met the baby by that point and by calling it a Baby Shower might make people think they have to bring something even if they already brought something when they met the baby the first time.

She also suggested if the party is earlier then it will involve our house being invaded by lots of people, however I think we will still be invaded by people wanting to bring their other halves or children, given that they will have been excluded from the Baby Party.

I'm currently 22weeks pregnant. I had some intermittent light spotting throughout my first trimester. I saw my GP, who told me I was having a miscarriage, and booked me for some blood tests to confirm my hcg levels were going down appropriately - turns out nope, they were going up. I had an early u/s, everything was looking normal, and I was referred to a midwife. I had spotting three more times during the first 12 weeks, but was otherwise progressing normally. It seemed to stop at 12 weeks, until week 20.

A week and a half ago - spotting again, similar to before it was really light (just when wiping, a couple of times). I panicked, paged the midwife, and she had me come in to the hospital as she was already there with a delivery. I had just had my anatomy scan the week before, everything was fine, placenta is not on the cervix, cervix is a normal length, etc. She checked the heartbeat right away, it took a minute to find (longest minute of my life) but was also good. Then I had the absolute worst pelvic exam - sterile swab so no lube, seriously painful, took about 10 minutes, and they took multiple samples and confirmed no blood was coming from my cervix and that it was far back and closed. I got sent home finally, told I probably have a yeast infection that is irritating my cervix but will hear back when they have the cultures. 

I get a call last Monday - I have bacterial vaginosis, and need to take antibiotics. I have to go to a clinic Wednesday to get the prescription, it takes two hours and the doctor there freaks me out by saying there's no way the BV caused the spotting. He checks the baby's heartbeat (just fine) and my blood pressure and gives me the prescription. 

So I've been on clindamycin cream for five days, and last night I have some light spotting, AGAIN. I am so over this. I paged the midwife, was told if it's light, I have no cramps, etc that it's probably just a reaction to the meds or that the BV is still irritating me. I can feel the baby moving around, which is reassuring, but I feel like I've been stressed out and anxious about this pregnancy since I found out about it. I just want to be upset by gaining weight or being uncomfortable or getting acne or something normal, instead of constantly worrying that something is horribly wrong. (I also had a ""abnormal NT result) at a 10wk u/s booked because of spotting - did the Harmony test and that came back fine, but it was a pretty rough 2 weeks).

TL/DR - I'm tired of spotting, of cream vaginal antibiotics, of constantly worrying about my pregnancy, of having to page my midwife all the time and being so high-maintenance. Thanks for letting me rant!",False,

My mono-mono girls are almost 11 months (9 adjusted). They are identical twins but couldn't be more different. For example, twin A can't stop eating (we have to hide so she can't see us eat or she screams lol) and twin B hates food, meal times are always a struggle. There's now a 2lb difference between them.

But more concerning to me is how far ahead twin A is with her development. She's been pulling herself up and trying to climb on everything for a few weeks now. She can already get to standing position with no support but falls quickly. She babbles a lot and is generally ahead in all other things.

Twin B is just now figuring out how to get into a seated position on her own (but she can sit indefinitely if we put her there). She wants to pull herself up in her crib or couch but gets frustrated and just sits there screaming for someone to do it for her. She babbles a bit here and there but is pretty quiet otherwise. There's other differences but those are just some examples. She's also a VERY energetic baby who just can't sit still (this is a reason she hates eating) while her sister is a bit more calm. 

There were no concerns at their 9 month pediatric appointment, nor with an infant development specialist at the time. However, they only see the babies for 30 min max and make an assessment. I spend 90% of my time with them so I notice a lot more and can't help but worry. 

The hard part is that I can't spend much extra time with twin B to help her out because, well... twins. The 2:1 ratio makes it hard to balance. 

Did anyone else notice major differences between their identical twins? Should I be concerned that she can't sit/pull herself up yet or that she doesn't babble much? It's SO hard not to compare, even though I know I shouldn't. These are my only kids so I'm so new to all of this.

- Buy a spaghetti squash!

- Prick the spaghetti squash all over with a skewer so it will not burst while baking.

- Place whole squash in a shallow baking pan.

- Bake in preheated 375 F oven for 1 hour.

- When cool enough to handle, cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise with a serrated knife.

 - Scoop the seeds and fibrous strings from the center of the cooked spaghetti squash.

- Gently scrape the tines of a kitchen fork around the edge of the spaghetti squash to shred the pulp into strands.

1 lb ground beef

2 garlic cloves, minced

1/2 cup chopped parsley

1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese

1 medium onion, finely chopped

1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs

2 large eggs, beaten

3 tablespoons dry red wine (optional)

2 tablespoons tomato paste (or ketchup!)

1 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

- Mix all ingredients up to the dried oregano with your hands.

- Scoop out mixture in heaping tablespoons and form into 2-inch balls.

- Place in baking pan and cook in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25-30 minutes.

 It's the same temperature as the spaghetti squash so you can just put these next to each other in the oven, and in the 30 minutes of squash-lead-time, you can make the meatballs!

The second portion of mediation was today. Because BM made a big deal about my being there last time, I didn't go for moral support. I wish I had.

That's not something SO was addressing as an issue that needs resolved. ~~But *we're* the money-hungry ones who only want primary for the money; bitch, please.~~

Also, for some reason, the mediator thinks that BM should get an uninterrupted week during the summer. *Seriously?* Aside from 3 weekends a month and half the holidays, she has *so much more time with them* that's uninterrupted. Is SO going to get an uninterrupted week or two during the school year? No? *~~Then fuck off!~~

He wasn’t really able to describe it in great detail, but that’s not my point.  He has never once come into our room as the result of a nightmare.  He’s never been affected by them.  Nor by thunder or wind or anything like that.  We’ve always simply told him what dreams are, how they’re not “real,” and all that stuff.  (And what thunder and wind are for that matter.)  Our 9 year old never had issues with nightmares either.

Of course both have had/still have them, but they aren’t bothered by them any more than I am.  

Neither has ever been taught or told anything about Judgmental sky daddies or devils or demons or angels or any of that nonsense.  Therefore, they’ve never had it implanted in their heads that any magic invisible entities exist in any way.  (Note: this hasn’t diminished their fervent and fun imaginations in any way.)  I know from experience – and from siblings – that threats like “God is watching you” and stuff like that, have an effect on a kid.

Doctor confirms she was going into labor.

Hey folks, just wanted to say this is a great sub that’s given me so much guidance in the past, thank you all.

I wanted to know your experience with paying for things like school clothes for SKs.  BM has primary physical custody, SO has visitation and joint legal custody. Medical is currently paid through an HSA which has been set up for the interim until decisions are made on who does what. BM has full unrestricted access to it and has never contributed to it with any of the money given to her by CS or alimony (or at all). Custody was voluntarily changed due to work schedules and family issues requiring out of state relocation. BM wouldn’t budge. Previous to move, primary physical custody was with SO.

While SKs were here last holiday, we noticed neither had had a haircut since late last year’s change of custody, about 6 months had elapsed. We worried notes may be sent home due to unkempt appearance of their hair after a certain length. Furthermore, the eldest SKs shoes were about a size and a half too small with the sole worn down to the white part. SK indicates shoes were annoying them. We asked if SK has approached BM for a new pair and it sounded as though SK did not want to ruffle BM’s feathers. SK has a complex relationship with BM due to trust issues and lack of bonding/closeness due to an extended no contact absence that took place for a few years...in other words i don’t think SK ever asked for a new pair of shoes. So there’s that, which begs the question...should SK expect to proactively ask about their needs or should they expect the parent to have observed this by now? Furthermore SK has documented vision problems that have been getting worse according to SK. BM took SK to eye doctor who said it was no big deal and ball was dropped. SK complains of social stigma of the eye problem (made fun of for it) and difficulty seeing. 

The CO has not been fully codified yet, what’s fair and not fair for a person to pay who already allocating 3k for two children in child support to BM monthly? Am i nitpicking? Are these behaviors concerning? Should BM be spending on new shoes, new glasses and vision correction training, hair cuts using her monthly child support checks? What if she chooses not to? What things does CS cover? If we cover these costs while SK is with us over summer break will that establish a precedent that the courts will rely on to suggest we pay for that + full CS? Do you buy clothes that stay home with you so BM can use her allocated money for what it’s technically for? What should we do if we continue to notice these seemingly minor (but stacking up) lapses in getting SKs what they need? Are these need to have or nice to have? What are your thoughts?",False,

946,"Trigger warning: PPD/PPA/Idon'tevenknowanymore

This week has been the week from hell. I'm supposed to be finishing up a project for work right now, but I can't concentrate for shit, so here I am.

I have a daughter who's 3.5 and a daughter who's 5 months. I have a wonderful husband. I have a job that's extremely flexible, a house, two pets. I have a good life.

But I can't handle it anymore. My husband was out of town for one night for business this week, and both girls came down with a cold the day he left. My older daughter's worsened into croup last night, so we had to race to the pediatrician's office and get her a steroid shot. Her fever hit 103.9 and it was scary. She's feeling better now, but that was one haunting cough she had last night. My baby keeps crying because I'm tending to her big sister instead of her. I'm afraid she's going to get croup too. No matter what I do, I feel like one of my girls is being neglected. I feel like I'm giving them everything I've got and it's nowhere close to enough.

I work from home. It's a technical writing job, so as long as I have everything turned in by Friday at noon, it's fine. I'm working during nap time if the baby will let me put her down, while I cook dinner, after kids go to bed until I can't keep my eyes open anymore around midnight/1 am. (Baby girl is still breastfeeding, so I'm up every couple hours in the night feeding and resettling her. She won't take a bottle, so I can't take a night off, either. She'd wake up the entire house.) No matter how time-consuming my project is for the week, there's no real chance for me to say ""Hey babe, can you come home and watch the kids? I need to work,"" because my husband's job is the priority. It's the one that primarily supports our household. I need to keep mine to keep a foot in the professional door for when the kids are old enough to be in school all day (yes, I'm in the US and this is a major concern), but it is logically the less important job in the household so I just have to deal. I usually have a babysitter come twice a week to entertain the older daughter while I get some work done, but this week I had to cancel that because both girls were sick. I've been trapped in the house for four days and counting, because they're both too sick to even run errands with me.

Because I am this weird combination of working mom/SAHM, it's also my job to keep track of appointments, get older daughter back and forth to preschool, and help out in the classroom on my scheduled days (it's a co-op). And grocery shop, and make sure they both have clothes that fit and are clean. Classroom time takes a big chunk out of the time I'd normally be working, so I have to rearrange the whole week twice a month. I also do most of the cooking, but I wouldn't change that because it's the only break I get from the kids.

You guys, no matter what I do, I feel like a failure at this point. Starting in January, my husband will be working his current job and also teaching a class at the local university. I can barely handle the life we're living now; how am I supposed to fit in another responsibility? The kitchen is a disaster zone right now, because my husband is sick too so the only dishes that get washed are the ones I clean for that night's cooking. I know he can't help being sick, but the fact that it happened the same week that he was also out of town for a night has just broken me. I have such a short temper right now, I can't stop crying, and I can't stop thinking that my girls deserve better.

We have no family nearby, and the fact that baby doesn't take a bottle really limits our babysitting options. I know I need a break, but I don't know how to take it. I just...I don't know. I feel so alone. I feel like if I forget one little detail, our whole world is going to crash down because it was all on my shoulders.

Right now I am doing just fine with my VW Jetta. Groceries fit in the trunk with my single frame stroller (I wear one and stroller the other). We wear the boys for big Costco trips so plenty of trunk space. We have enough leg room in the front seat with the Graco Snugrides in the back. If there's another adult, I can even squeeze in the back middle seat between the boys. Double Bob fits in the trunk if I take the wheels off and, honestly, that thing is so big and unwieldy that I would probably take the wheels off either way. Have done weekend trips to the in laws and are able to fit everything okay.

We do sometimes struggle to get the carseats out of the car in a tight parking space and I know mini vans have the sliding doors. However, the minivan will also be wider than my sedan, so won't it be a wash?

If we took a big car trip and wanted to bring the stroller plus a bunch of luggage, that would be tough. But I don't really want to take a big road trip with infants! And, for the number of times we would do it, would it make more sense to rent a van for that specific trip?

She goes to daycare so we use diapers there but as soon as we come home, we tell her we don’t use diapers at home anymore and that she needs to go in the potty. She is naked from the waist down; it makes it easy to go to potty. The first couple days, we had peepee accidents but all poop were done in the potty. By the 5th day, she goes to the potty by herself to pee or poop. We had to ask every 15mins but sometimes she goes on her own. Daycare will only allow no diapers if she is fully potty trained which means she has to go to the “mini” toilets, pull down her pants, go potty, wipe herself, and put her pants back on (flushing optional). The reason is that they have to be in constant eyesight with other kids and cannot go to the bathroom stall with her. How do you exactly train a 22 month old to pull down her pants and wipe herself?

Sd7 decided once and for all that she had to prove that my husband is HER Daddy and that she can make him do whatever she wants. (Yes, I know this is probably not her actual thoughts or intentions. I literally got maybe 2 hours of sleep last night and I am NOT happy. I am sure my actual reason will return when I can sleep). 

Last night was a living Hell.  Sd7 absolutely dug her heels in and fought tooth and nail for HOURS. She kept the baby up all friggin night.  She thrashed and kicked the wall and sobbed and screamed.  FOR HOURS. Sd5 participated in the chaos half heartedly for maybe 15 min then pulled her covers over her head and fell asleep. Sd7 begged for her mommy, demanded to sleep with my husband then begged. Then just screamed.  This child is so insanely stubborn. 

I have to say though that I am proud of my husband.  As wretched as last night was he did not give in.  He told her he loved her. He kissed her good night.  He went in a few times at first. He was affectionate and gentle. And then firm. And then down right stern.  And then he decided that he was done paying any attention to her at all until she acts right and he stuck to that. 

She finally was quiet just before 5 AM.  The baby had a very hard time settling down and was up and down until 6:30. But finally it looks like all 3 girls are sleeping.

999,"Weird post-cervix check bleeding. Induction date. Mom making me nervous. L&amp;D trip that was ultimately for nothing. Mcdonalds for both meals. Ugh.

So today is exactly 39 weeks for me, and it started off pretty normal. I had an appointment at about 10:30, and it was my last in my OB's office. So everything goes normally, including the damned cervical check. I HATE the cervical checks. I always clamp up and get super nervous when people are down there. You can tell me to 'relax' all you want, but my body is always like 'yeah NO this is not happening'. And it really sucks. Anyway OB did the check and informed that that there was literally no change from last week, where I was 1cm dilated and 40% soft. Well damn, I thought in a weeks time, I could at least dilate another HALF centimeter! Guess not. OB tells me to get dressed while he goes and schedules an induction.

Wait, an induction? You mean like...a day I go in and you make me start having a baby!? Okay...

So I get dressed and I noticed as I'm cleaning myself up that there was alot more blood this time after the check. Quite a bit more. Oh well, I guess I'll keep an eye on it. Good thing I brought a panty liner with me. Doc comes back, the date is set for next monday the 26th (My due date) at 8pm. I'm getting induced right at 40 weeks. Note that I don't really have any sort of complications in my pregnancy, it has been pretty healthy. I ask doc why, and tells me he doesn't want my baby in for too long and hes worried about the functionality of my placenta at that time. Okay, this is fine. He is my doctor after all. The nurses at the hospital really like him and he has good reviews, and I dont really have a reason not to trust his judgement. I trust medical professionals. I leave the office, head for Mcdonalds and go to my fathers small business to chat and to prove to him that he was wrong about the chicken mcnuggets (he hated them but hadn't tried them in like 20 years. I proved him wrong. He liked them). After about an hour and a half, I started feeling weird in my pants. Like extra wet. So I go and check and there is ALOT of blood. Mixed with gloopyness. Like big blood clots, and not just mucus with streaks in it. It was all bright red. The whole panty liner was filled and 'spilling over'. This was a bit more bleeding than the spotting that the doc told me would be normal after a check. So I excuse myself and drive home and call the doc, who instructed me to go to L&amp;D.

Before I left the house, I called my mother back, who wanted to know how my doc visit went. And I told her about the induction date. And she was not happy. Her tone dropped and she was, well, concerned. ""And the doctor suggested this?'   ""is this what they normally do?'    ""does this sound right to you?""  
Yes mom. I can assure you with my completely non-existent medical education and history that this is exactly what every doctor in the world would say was a great idea. Then she asked if I could go get a second opinion. With 1 week left? No, not really, its a bit late. So I end the call rather quickly (cause, you know, bleeding) and her reaction makes me feel even more nervous/panicky. I trust my doctor......right? Anyway, get back in my car, and call and let the husband know I'm going into L&amp;D to get checked and everything was probably fine and he doesnt have to come down to the hospital, blah blah blah.

Get to the hospital and check in, the nurses are really nice, and give me comfy socks and a super sexy gown (hah), and I get settled into triage to get monitored. Note this was my first time in L&amp;D and didnt know what to expect. Well, it was pretty boring. I sat there listening to baby's heartbeat, which sounded good, and laughed at him kicking the crap out of the monitor. He did not like the thing around my belly. But then 30 minutes go by and I get pretty bored, and husband calls me. There was some stuff going on in the triage bed next to mine so i didn't answer. Turns out I didnt need to because 3 minutes later my husband walks in the room and behind my curtain. Surprise! As it so happens, after my phone call he was piratically useless at work with worry and whatnot so he just took a half day. We sit for another 30ish minutes and the head nurse comes in to inform me that baby looks good, contractions are minimal, and shes going to check me to see where the blood is coming from. Ugh, not more shoving things up my vagina! I hate it so much! She does the most uncomfortable cervix check in the world, informs me that the blood is coming from the opening of my cervix and I'm just 'spot' bleeding more than normal, which isnt a bad thing. Tells me the bleeding can continue for 4 days (!!) and I can go home. Thats it. I just bleed alot from my vagina, apparently. 

After I told husband about my chicken mcnugget lunch, he decided he really needed some nuggets as well and we went to mcdonalds for dinner on the way home. And now I feel kinda awful. Like I poisoned my body. But baby is okay. And I am okay. So everything is okay. Except for the terrifying induction date now looming in my mind. And the way my mom reacted about it, which makes me even more panicky about it. 

Is 40 weeks too early to induce? It IS my due date, as well as the doctor's recommendation.

He told me he does it because his friends are doing it, and he tries to copy what they do, to fit in. His friend Olojo (12) steals whole chickens using this method (these chickens are usually £4 to £6 each), and Olojo has been doing it for 2 years.

I am starting Yaz today to treat my acne. Up until 6 months ago, I was on Diane-35 for an year that worked wonderfully for me without any bad side effects. I had to stop because I was out of the country for awhile and ran out of supplies. My acne has been creeping back and so I decided to go back on BC but this time on Yaz because I no longer have insurance that covers Diane-35. 

So, the question is: Should I continue to use products targeting acne (i.e. moisturizer with 0.5% salicylic acid) while I’m on Yaz? I don’t want to put too much stress on my skin if it’s going to clear up from the pill.

I've had so many ups and downs this cycle. Had some planned sexy times that ended with DH not being able to finish :( I thought I was out but then we snuck in some morning sex on my O day and I got all excited and hopeful even though DH hadn't cleaned out the pipes in awhile lol so not sure if there would have even been any good sperm there. Then my temps started out super high and have stayed higher than they ever have! Of course I went nuts and started testing at 8 DPO because if I'm really pregnant it would show right?? Lol my logic is nuts right now. Of course BFN every day since and I've been so utterly depressed. I can't take this crazy roller coaster of emotions! I even pulled a test out of the trash and was convinced the evap line was a positive but of course it's hours after I tested and definitely not positive. I've already taken two tests today because I am a crazy lady and will probably take another as soon as I've got a 4 hour hold in me. I can't stop looking at pregnancy charts and comparing my symptoms. I had some irritation immediately following O which I think was due to a reaction from the pre seed but of course I looked up yeast infections as a sign of pregnancy and apparently they are. Then I checked my cm and although it's still creamy it smelled a bit metallic like AF is coming and I bawled like a baby. This cycle is going to destroy me!!

1077,"tl;dr - Have been co-sleeping with my 7mo old son and I've gotten addicted to the ease of being able to nurse him back to sleep. How easy/hard was it to transition baby back to crib?

Some background.. My son is almost 7 months old. Between when he was about 3 1/2 months to 5 1/2 months, he was sleeping in his crib. At first, it was difficult to get him to fall asleep (and stay asleep) but it's gotten progressively better. For the few weeks before he turned 6 months, he would simply fall asleep nursing and I would then just transfer him to his crib. He'd wake up twice throughout the night and I'd nurse him back to sleep. After the second time, usually around 5am, I would just let him finish sleeping in my bed. That was my ideal situation and I thought we had finally gotten a good night routine.

However, in the past few weeks, he started to wake up more frequently and was harder to transfer into the crib. He would wake up the second his head touched the crib mattress or within an hour of putting him down. It made me so tired that it eventually led us to co-sleeping. At first, I blamed his crappy sleep on the 6 month sleep regression. Then I blamed it on teething. Now, I'm blaming it on the 6 month vaccinations he received yesterday. 

I love co-sleeping because it's so easy for me to nurse LO back to sleep if he wakes up. But regardless of whether or not I shot myself in the foot and let LO (and myself) get comfy with co-sleeping or if it's because of a regression/teething/vaccinations, I want my bed back! I'm getting about the same number of hours of sleep but I'm sleeping so much more comfortably without him there. Other than just being persistent with putting him back in his crib to sleep, does anyone have tips/success stories of going from co-sleeping to crib? And would I be doing more harm than good transitioning slowly (because eventually, I'm going to run out of excuses for his crappy sleep)?",True,child appearances
